## Emergency measures legal instrument (*emlaw*) 

*Question*: What legal instrument has the state used to adopt a national-level emergency response to the Covid-19 pandemic? 

*Clarification*: Here we are interested in the primary legal instrument used to adopt and enforce the main national-level emergency measures with reference to Covid-19 since March 11, 2020. If the country has used multiple instruments, choose the one that most closely resembles a ``state of exception”, defined as a period during which one person or the government has enhanced powers and authority to limit rights and freedoms beyond what the law ordinarily allows (e.g. see [link](https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/S/bo3534874.html) (Agamben 2005). Note that the emergency measures may have ended by the time of coding. 

*Scale*: Categorical 

 1. Declaration of state of emergency, within existing legal framework. 
 2. Declaration of state of public health emergency, within existing legal framework that distinguishes between a public health emergency and a state of emergency. 
 3. Declaration of state of disaster / catastrophe, within existing legal frameworks where this differs from a state of emergency. 
 4. Adopting new legislation, where this differs from a state of emergency, public health emergency, or disaster/catastrophe. 
 5. None, the state has a national-level emergency response without specific reference to legal instruments. 
 6. None, the state has no national-level emergency response. 
 7. Other. 

*Answer*: 4 

*Comments*:
 Algeria adopted several gradual measures through decrees. The decrees are based on the Constitution and other legal acts, but the articles on which they are based are not related to emergency powers, but rather ''normal'' lawming powers. 
For example, the decrees  No. 20-69 of March 21, 2020, and 20-70 of March 24, 2020 refer legally to the Constitution, articles 99-4° and 143, or the law n° 88-07 du 7 Joumada Ethania 1408 correspondant au 26 janvier 1988 relative à l’hygiène, à la sécurité et à la médecine du travail ; 

Article 99 (4) of the Cosntitution: 
In addition to the powers explicitly conferred upon him by other provisions of the Constitution, the Prime Minister shall exercise the following functions:
4. he shall sign the executive decrees;

Art 143: Matters other than those earmarked for statutory legislation shall fall within the regulatory power of the President of the Republic. The implementation of the laws shall be a matter for the regulatory field of the Prime Minister

''Faced with the Covid-19 health crisis and the development of cases affecting the country, the Algerian Government has gradually taken a series of general measures aimed at containing the spread of the virus. These measures have been the subject of two main texts:

Executive Decree No. 20-69 of March 21, 2020 relating to measures to prevent and combat the spread of Coronavirus (Covid-19) and, the purpose of which is to establish measures of social distancing intended to prevent and combat the spread of COVID-19;
 
Executive Decree No. 20-70 of March 24, 2020 establishing additional measures to prevent and combat the spread of Coronavirus (Covid-19) and which has as its object the establishment of containment devices, restriction of circulation, framing of citizens' trade and supply activities, of rules of distancing as well as the methods of citizen mobilization in the national effort to prevent and combat the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic.''

## Beginning of emergency response (*emstart*) 

*Question*: When did the government first adopt this legal instrument in response to Covid-19? 

*Clarification*: This refers to the date that the legal instrument defined in *emlaw* was first used to enact a national-level emergency response to the Covid-19 pandemic. If the exact date is unknown, the first day of the month is given. If unknown, leave blank. 

*Scale*: Date format. 

*Answer*: 2020-03-21 

*Comments*:
 This is the date of the first decree issued, because although the second decree was stricter in terms of measures (has as its object the establishment of containment devices, restriction of circulation, framing of citizens' trade and supply activities, of rules of distancing as well as the methods of citizen mobilization in the national effort to prevent and combat the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic), the scope of it was mostly subnational. The first decree related to the more general measures.

''On Sunday, June 7, Algerian authorities eased restrictions enacted to limit the spread of COVID-19. During this first phase of easing, several industries were permitted to resume operations, including plumbers, painters, travel agents, fast food restaurants (take-away only), and art galleries.''

''All land borders remain closed and non-cargo international air and maritime travel, as well as domestic flights, are suspended. Public spaces including schools, universities, and mosques also remain closed.''

## Law legislature approval (*emlawapp*) 

*Question*: Does the law require that the national legislature approve the implementation of the legal instrument used as the main national-level response to Covid-19? 

*Clarification*:  Does the law require that the national legislature approve the implementation of the legal instrument used as the main national-level response to Covid-19? 

*Scale*: Binary (0/1). 

 0. No. 
 1. Yes. 

*Answer*: 0 

*Comments*:
 It seems like even under normal times, the President has the right to issue and sign decrees without the approval of Parliament. 

''While the National People’s Assembly is suspended, the President of the Republic may legislate on urgent matters by issuing ordinances after consultation with the Council of State (the administrative court). Such ordinances issued by the President must be submitted to the legislative branch at its next session for ratification.''

Constitution 1989 (reinst. 1996, rev. 2016), article 99 (4): In addition to the powers explicitly conferred upon him by other provisions of the Constitution, the Prime Minister shall exercise the following functions:
4. he shall sign the executive decrees;

## Legislature approval (*emlegapp*) 

*Question*: Did the legislature approve the implementation of the legal instrument used as the main national-level response to Covid-19? 

*Clarification*: This question refers to the legal instrument used to adopt the enhanced powers as defined in *emlaw*. By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws. 

*Scale*: Binary (0/1). 

 0. No. 
 1. Yes. 

*Answer*: 0 

*Comments*:

## Legislature limitations (*leglimit*) 

*Question*: To what extent is the lawmaking role of the legislature limited due to any of the emergency measures taken with reference to the Covid-19 pandemic? 

*Clarification*: By national legislature, we mean the national body with powers to examine, pass, amend, or repeal laws.   The lawmaking role of the national legislature includes the de-jure and de-facto powers to introduce and pass legislation in all policy areas. This question asks specifically how the emergency measures have affected the lawmaking powers of the legislature. ``Rule by decree” enables the government to pass laws without the approval of the legislature, through what is commonly referred to as a decree, regulation, or ordinance, but can also be referred to by other terms.  If no legislature existed prior to Covid-19, code as 5. 

*Scale*: Categorical, (0-5) 

 0. Not at all. The lawmaking role of the national legislature is not affected. 
 1. Very little. The legislature has given the executive branch the power to relatively widely interpret Covid-19 related laws, but not to rule by decree. 
 2. Somewhat. The executive branch has the right to rule by decree on several, narrowly Covid-19 related issues such as deciding on physical distance measures and measures to support the health system. 
 3. To a large extent. The executive branch has the right to rule by decree on many issues, which may exceed Covid-19 related issues due to vague formulation in emergency laws. 
 4. Completely. The legislature has been dissolved, suspended or equivalent with reference to Covid-19. 
 5. No legislature existed prior to Covid-19. 

*Answer*: 3 

*Comments*:
 In March, the U.S. Library of Congress reported that the Chairman of the National Assembly had postponed all sessions and activities as a preventive measure against Covid-19. But on 22 April 2020, Aljazeera reported that the National Assembly passed a new law to criminalize fake news in a fairly empty sitting due to social distancing measures. In addition, the IDEA data on legislatures says that the Algerian National Assembly has normal procedure in April. However, the legislature is still not entirely suspended, given that any laws passed while the legislature was temporarily suspended must be retroactively agreed to, but severe restrictions on who can attend and take the floor in the legislature.

## Sub-national variation (*subvar*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, to what extent have the emergency measures referring to Covid-19 varied de jure at the sub-national level? 

*Clarification*: Coders should identify and cite sources indicating that subnational governments have implemented varying responses to the pandemic between 11 March 2020 until the coding date. 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Almost no variation. The emergency measures are uniform or nearly uniform throughout the country. 
 1. A little. There are a few sub-national areas where the emergency measures differ. 
 2. Somewhat. There are some sub-national areas where the emergency measures differ. 
 3. Almost completely. The emergency measures vary across all or almost all of the sub-national areas of the country. 

*Answer*: 2 

*Comments*:
 'The various measures are applicable throughout the national territory for a period which was brought to this stage to April 19. Failure to comply with them is liable to result in administrative sanctions (immediate withdrawal of administrative authorizations to carry out activities) and criminal sanctions without these being expressly defined.''

The partial measures - lockdowns, curfews, etc vary subnationally.

## Discrim (*discrim*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, have any of the emergency measures that place restrictions on democratic rights or freedoms discriminated "solely on the ground of race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin" (ICCPR Art 4)? 

*Clarification*: This indicator captures whether the emergency measures have affected some groups' democratic rights and freedoms disproportionately based on their race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin in ways that cannot be justified by concerns for public health. Democratic rights and freedoms are defined as freedom of movement, assembly, association, and expression. This includes, for instance, quarantines for specific social groups without explicit virological indication. If measures are applied to neighborhoods due to prevalence of Covid-19 cases, this does not count as discrimination. Do not code cases of discrimination dealing with access to medical care, testing, or supplies. 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. No, not at all. 
 1. Not de-jure, but minor de-facto discrimination. 
 2. Not de-jure, but major, systematic de-facto discrimination. 
 3. Yes, minor de-jure discrimination. 
 4. Yes, major, systematic de-jure discrimination 

*Answer*: 0 

*Comments*:
 There are reports on the government discriminating against activists from Hirak, but the discrimination of these activists is based on political basis (them being opposition activists).

## Non-derogable rights (*ndrights*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, have any of the emergency measures de-jure violated non-derogable rights as defined by the ICCPR? 

*Clarification*: This question addresses the text of the main national-level emergency measures (de-jure). Do not consider the extent to which such provisions have been enforced. Non-derogable rights include: 
 - Right to life (Article 6). 
 - Freedom from torture and cruel/inhuman treatment (Article 7).  
 - Prohibition of slavery and servitude (Article 8, I and II). 
 - Prohibition of imprisonment due to inability to fulfill a contractual obligation (Article 11). 
 - No conviction for a crime which was not a crime at the time of commitment (Article 15). 
 - Right as a person before the law (Article 16). 
 - Freedom of thought, conscience and religion (Article 18). The detailed ICCPR provisions can be found [here](www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx). A temporary ban on religious services does NOT count as a violation of freedom of religion as long as all religions are targeted equally. Provide detailed information about the de-jure violations, including which non-derogable rights are violated in the ndrights_comments variable. 

*Scale*: Binary, (0/1)

## Media limitations (*melim*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, to what extent do any emergency measures de-jure limit media freedom? 

*Clarification*: This addresses the text of the main national-level emergency measures (de-jure). Do not consider the extent to which such provisions have been enforced. Coders should only consider how the emergency measures affect media freedoms within the country, not other laws or practices. For instance, a case may be coded as 0 - "Not at all" if the emergency measures do not de-jure limit media freedoms, even if the case already had low media freedoms in practice prior to the crisis. 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Not at all. Media freedoms are not affected by the emergency measures. 
 1. Somewhat. The emergency measures de-jure allow the government to put some limitations on how the media can report on Covid-19. These provisions are explicitly limited to stopping disinformation on Covid-19, such as closing news websites that misreport on the origins or how the disease spreads (as a reference to 'fact check' what is 'disinformation'', please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided [here](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses)). 
 2. To a large extent. The emergency measures de-jure put strict limitations on how the media can report on Covid-19. These provisions are not limited to stopping the spread of disinformation on Covid-19, but include any reporting on Covid-19 such as the prevalence of the virus and the government response (as a reference to 'fact check' what is 'disinformation', please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided [here](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses)). 
 3. Almost completely. The emergency measures de-jure require that all or almost all media reporting on Covid-19 reflect the government's position.  

*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 'Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, the government of Algeria headed by newly elected President Abdelmadjid Tebboune approved a bill amending the country’s penal code to criminalize the spreading of “false news” that harms national unity. The sweeping new law gives authorities powers to tackle misinformation about the virus, but also opens the door to possible censorship. Penalties range between two to five years in jail and carry fines of up to €3,600.''

LAW 20-06 AMENDING THE PENAL CODE - 
The amendments increase prison sentences for defamation, and introduce new penalties including prison sentences for the dissemination of false information. Under the amendments, new offenders face prison sentences of between one and three years. In addition, penalties are heightened if the offence takes place “at a time of a public health lockdown or a natural, biological or technological catastrophe or any other form of catastrophe,” with first time offenders facing up to five years in prison

The Algerian governmen, in an attempt to curb the very real dangers caused by dis- and misinformation disseminated by conspiracy theorists and fabulists has been to pass a new law criminalising the broadcast of “fake news” deemed harmful to “public order and state security”. The law, approved by parliament on 22 April, 2020, has come in for criticism by free speech activists, who point out that it could be used to curb independent reporting of the government’s failings in tackling the pandemic. These deficiencies, such as the lack of adequate preventative measures in hospitals, have prompted some doctors to post videos on social media in which they draw attention to the difficult circumstances they are working under. The new law could be used to suppress such reports.''

## Government misinformation (*govmis*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, how often does information provided by the government or its agents about Covid-19 related matters deviate from the official information provided by the World Health Organization (WHO)? 

*Clarification*: This question is not about specific policies on Covid-19 or minor variations on how governments officially communicate about Covid-19-related matters (e.g. whether masks are recommended or not) but aims at capturing the dissemination of gravely misleading and false information by governments on key facts about Covid-19 such as what it is, how it is transmitted, or how it can be treated or cured. As a reference to “fact check” what is ``false", please use the WHO information on Covid-19 provided here: https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses. Coders should document the source showing the information from the government or its agents and explain how this deviates from the official WHO information (using the source and comments fields). 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0.  Never, or almost never. The information provided by the government and its agents' never or almost never deviates from the official information provided by the WHO. 
 1. Occasionally. There are a few reported instances where the government or its agents have communicated information on Covid-19 that deviates from the official information provided by the WHO, but this is not necessarily intentional. 
 2. Often. The government or some of its agents frequently disseminate information on many key issues concerning Covid-19 that deviates from official information provided by the WHO. 
 3. Always or almost always. The government and its agents systematically disseminate information on a wide range of basic matters concerning Covid-19 that always or almost always deviates from the official information provided by the WHO. 

*Answer*: 2 

*Comments*:
 'According to the Scientific Committee for Monitoring the Evolution of the Pandemic,  9,000 cases of contamination have been officially recorded in Algeria, including 630 deaths, since the registration of the first case on February 25. Despite the decision of the World Health Organization (WHO) to suspend clinical trials, Algeria has decided to continue the use of hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of coronavirus.''

## Physical violence by police, military (*pomviol*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, how often have security forces, such as the civilian police or military, engaged in physical violence to execute the emergency measures? 

*Clarification*: Physical violence refers to the use of force or intimidation to harm or kill another individual, forced unlawful confinement, or harassment (including physical, psychological, and sexual in nature). 

*Scale*: Ordinal, (0-3) 

 0. Never or almost never. Security forces seem to have engaged in little to no violence to execute the emergency measures. 
 1. Rarely. A few isolated incidents of security forces engaging in some non-lethal violence have been reported. 
 2. Sometimes. There are several reports of security forces engaging in violence to execute the emergency measures, and/or reports of deaths at the hands of security forces in response to Covid-19 enforcement. 
 3. Often. There are widespread reports about use of violence, sometimes with lethal outcomes, by security forces when executing emergency measures taken with reference to Covid-19. 

*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 Although the police incidents have been targeted against political opponents during the demonstrations that took place, it is still within the enforcement of the covid19 measures because the government had banned public gatherings.

''When thousands of Algerians went out to demonstrate on March 7, the government response was overly severe. Security forces mobilized in large numbers to stop the demonstration, and police forces chased protesters and used clubs to beat them back. No distinction was made between men and women, young and old. Several activists, journalists, and students were arrested and accused of undermining national unity, including the famous journalist Khaled Drareni who was filming the protest live. Imene Meddour, a thirty-year-old mother, was arrested for posting a video that denounced the alleged corruption of officials managing a quarantine site in the city of Oran. Her baby was taken away while she was in confinement on April 2. Many perceived this action as excessive oppression, and her case went viral on social media.''

## Military involvement (*milinv*) 

*Question*: Since 11 March 2020, has the military been tasked with enforcing any confinement measures? 

*Clarification*: 'Confinement measures' refer to measures restricting citizens' freedom of movement. Such measures include  quarantines, lockdowns, curfews and  travel restriction within the country. 'The military' refers to the set of armed organizations responsible for external security that are primarily composed of active-duty members (as opposed to reserve forces). We are interested in whether the military has been given the power to ensure these measures are respected using coercion. We are not interested in whether the military is deployed to deliver aid or provide help to healthcare facilities.
