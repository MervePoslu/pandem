 'The draft proposal (last link on emlegaapp_source) explains that the government has to keep the Chamber of Representatives informed about the measures it takes in virtue of its special powers. However, this obligation was not formalised in the final act. Regarding the control of the government, Members of the Chamber of Representatives ask parliamentary questions regarding the actions of the government on a regular basis and a monitoring Commission (the COVID-19 Commission) was put in place in order to control the government’s actions, as in other federated entities.  At any time, Members of the Parliament can decide to adopt a new act withdrawing the special powers from the government if they go beyond these powers. Moreover, the fact that it is a minority government adds more pressure to strictly follow its mandate. Finally, as explained on this blog, the special powers acts and the special powers decrees can be attacked before the Constitutional Court and the Council of State respectively.''

# Lesotho 
*Answer*: 0 

*Comments*:
 The Parliament had been prorogued (March 19, 2020) in the initial declaration of the state of emergency (retrospectively on March 28, 2020, to be in force from March 18). In the second declaration of the state of emergency on April 15, 2020 the Parliament properly approved the extension, since the Constitutional court had ruled the suspension unconstitutional.

# Niger 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 The Nigerien legislature adopted unanimously (90 votes in favor, zero against and zero abstentions) on April 11, 2020 the bill extending the State of Emergency until July 11, 2020: ''This law aims to give the government the means to deal with the health emergency constituted by the coronavirus pandemic in a strengthened legal framework adaptable to the circumstances. After having noted the pathogenic and contagious nature of the covid-19 virus and the public health emergency that the evolution of its spread entails, the government has decided to extend it for a period of three months the State of emergency for the whole territory of Niger. The vote was held unanimously by the deputies present. Thus, the state of emergency is extended for the period from April 12 to July 11, 2020 inclusive.''
Note that when the President announced the declaration of the State of Emergency on March 27, 2020, he had not specified an end date. This was only added on April 11 when the bill passed from the National Assembly, and an extension until July 11 was given. The initial declaration did not require the approval of the Parliament.

*Comments*:
 The parliament has been dissolved since February 2020 due to elections (i.e. not covid-19) and therefore the declaration and extensions of the state of emergency were made by the government. Each decision has provisions for the need to be approved by the parliament, as soon as its able to meet. At the time of coding, the parliament has not met and consequently has not approved the decisions (both to declare a state of emergency and to extend it several times) yet.
