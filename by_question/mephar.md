# Madagascar 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 A tv host in Madagascar is detained: ''The TV host placed in pre-trial detention on Wednesday April 8, suspected of spreading false news on social networks concerning the number of cases of coronavirus, is also judged as a simple citizen. "She  was not a journalist and it was not in the course of her work that she was accused,  " insists the minister, who specifies that this host works for a channel which belongs to a minister of the current government.
Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the two women do not know when the trial will take place and this is what worries all the more Amnesty International and the Union de la Presse Francophone.''

# Rwanda 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 Journalists have been arrested.

''Journalist and media worker arrested for violating curfew in Rwanda:
Police in Rwanda arrested journalist Dieudonné Niyonsenga and media worker Fidèle Komezusenge for violating the country’s COVID-19 lockdown. Both were on their way to report at the time. The Rwanda Investigation Bureau announced criminal charges on Twitter. Rwanda’s lockdown does not explicitly exempt journalists from moving freely to work.''

Also: ''At least four bloggers were arrested in Rwanda earlier this month for violating the government's directives, as they tried to cover coronavirus lockdown measures, according to Human Rights Watch.''

Also: ''TV director Hassan had notably finished a sensitive report investigating the impact of Rwanda’s lockdown measures on locals in poor districts. “These journalists were asking questions about why authorities were demolishing homes deemed unstable in working class areas without compensating their occupants,” Laurent Munyandilikirwa, head of Rwanda’s Observatory for human rights told RFI. The government argues the measure was to protect inhabitants from torrential rains, but Munyandilikirwa says their homes were never located in flood-prone areas to begin with. “They (the journalists) crossed the red line by seeking the truth,” believes the rights defender, who has urged the government to release any media professional detained for their Covid-19 coverage.''
