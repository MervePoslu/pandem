# Bosnia and Herzegovina 
*Answer*: 0 

*Comments*:
 No de-jure disciminating provisions. The authorities have issued several documents on the importance of nondiscrimination. The government imposed severe lockdowns on people below 18 and above 65 years old, which can be potentially discriminatory (see Human Rights Watch link) and unjustified (e.g. due to low risks in children) but was imposed by the authorities based on public health grounds, therefore not coded as discrimination. The authorities also placed migrants into camps with potentially harmful conditions (see Amnesty International link), which is related to assess to medical care and supplies and therefore not coded as discrimination.

# Bulgaria 
*Answer*: 4 

*Comments*:
 Targeted discriminatory measures in Roma communities across the country, such as checkpoints and police patrols in Roma communities. According to the UN, the targeted Roma communities were Nova Zagora, Kazanlak, Sliven, Yambol, and Sofia. The measures were adopted de-jure by local councils (https://www.amnesty.sk/stigmatizujuca-karantena-romskych-komunit-na-slovensku-a-v-bulharsku/, also see order 12-201/17.03.2020 from Nova Zagora). Some areas (e.g. Burgas) used drones with thermal sensors for measuring temperature in quarantined Roma communities. The measures were announced at a press briefing by Ventsislav Mutafchiyski, the Head of the National Operational Headquarters (see video in an article by https://www.flashnews.bg/). The lockdown measures are still in place even after the state of emergency ended, such as in Yambol (Amnesty International).

# Burma/Myanmar 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 There are reports of some discrimination from law enforcement onto the Rohingyan population, who has been subject to harassment, as well as unlawful fines, when attempting to cross checkpoints that are part of the emergency measures. However, no sources indicate that this is national or regional policy, or that there are any more severe instances of de facto discrimination on going in relation to the Covid-19 emergency measures (the more severe discrimination of Rohingyans is from before the emergency measures and not part of the Covid-19 response, and thus not accounted for here). This is therefore coded as 1, minor de facto discrimination.

 There are many reports on unsanitary conditions of quarantine establishments, but no human rights violations based on these democratic rights:
''The aid and medical sources said that most sites lack the necessary hygiene and sanitation infrastructure, are severely overcrowded, and raise the risk of the virus spreading unchecked.''
''Although police and local officials have quarantined Burundians and foreigners traveling into the country by air or overland in hotels, schools, and other buildings, Burundian authorities have failed to ensure adequate food, health care, hygiene, and sanitation in some locations. Some humanitarian organizations have been blocked from reaching and providing assistance to people in quarantine.''

However, people with African roots have been treated unfairly and discriminated against. Examples of discrimination: Businessman from Niger was made to take a coronavirus test. He was then ordered to self-isolate at home for 14 days although he had not left Guangzhou since the outbreak nor had any contact with known infected persons. People of African descent were denied entry to the subway system for two weeks starting April 10. They were being placed in quarantine. despite no recent travel history or other risk factors. Some had magnetic strips and alarms installed on their doors to deter them from leaving. They have also been barred from entering certain supermarkets and restaurants.

# Finland

*Comments*:
 Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and EU agency of fundamental righs have not reported any discrimination within the response to Covid-19, and no indications have been found of it.
Worth noting however is that there's been debate in Finland as to whether the measures discriminate elderly and people living in institutions. For example, people in insitutions have not been allowed to have visitors due to health reasons, which has been very hard on some groups.
But this is not a case of the emergency measures actively discriminating some group, and this is thus coded as 0.

Available official data, as well as information published in the media, also indicate a considerable concentration of police stops to enforce lockdown measures in “quartiers populaires” – working-class neighborhoods with a high number of visible minority residents and, for example, a fine rate three times as high as the national average in Seine-Saint-Denis, the poorest neighborhood of Metropolitan France. The data and accounts suggest discriminatory behavior against citizens depending on where they live and a disproportionate impact of fines on socially and economically disadvantaged households, the organizations said.''

*Comments*:
 The announced and implemented mesures do not de jure discriminate against any particular social group. However, the government put in lockdwon refugee camps in the islands while no covid19 case had been found, and when the nationwide lockdown was lifted on May 4 2020, the government announced that the island camps will continue to be closed until May 21 without giving an explanation on its decision (the government had also put two refugee camps in the mainland (Ritsona and Malakasa camp) in lockdown, but this was after covid19 cases were found).

# Hungary 
*Answer*: 0 

*Comments*:
 The Hungarian Helsinki Committee argues that the measures used to expel Iranian students for violating the quarantine are discriminatory, but I have not found further confirmation of this in other sources. The authorities also suspended the admissions of refugees into the transit zone due to covid-19 concerns (most migrants coming from or transiting through Iran), although Human Rights Watch argues that most of them had been at the other side of the border for more than a year. Coded as 0 since the measures apply to people outside the country. Additional note: Hungarian parliament also passed a law prohibiting transgender or intersex people to change their gender, but this is not part of emergency measures (https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/05/21/hungary-ends-legal-recognition-transgender-and-intersex-people)

# Israel 
*Answer*: 0 

*Comments*:
 There are numerous reports of Israel’s policies on the Gaza Strip and West Bank leave Palestinians more exposed to Covid-19, and with less access to health care. Especially, the imposed travel ban on Palestinian territory by the Israeli government has caused concern of numerous Palestinians not being able to access sufficient health care if Covid-19 starts spreading widely. However, the policies toward these territories and the people living there are not related to the Covid-19 crisis, and have been in place long before that. Furthermore, no evidence has been found that the Israeli government has imposed any other regulations that restrict any democratic freedoms more for some groups. Thus, to the extent that Israeli policies actively discriminate Palestinians or other groups democratic rights, these have been in place before the crisis and are not related to the emergency response. This is therefore coded as 0.

# Kuwait 
*Answer*: 2 

*Comments*:
 The Covid-19 crisis has exacerbated pre-existing de facto discrimination against non-Kuwaiti nationals, despite some government action to try to redress migrant labour issues (particularly undocumented workers) and xenophobia. Some government lockdown measures were applied to neighbourhoods where many migrant workers live (there were cases of Covid-19 here so not coded), and the government has announced that as a result of the pandemic and associated economic crisis it will seek to reduce migrant labour numbers in future. This has contributed to an environment of discrimination against migrant labourers, including Kuwait MPs and journalists on state-owned media networks calling for deportation of migrants or restrictions on migrants to free up resources for nationals. Existing discrimination against migrant workers and the state’s unwillingness to hold Kuwaiti employers to account – for example over the non-payment of salaries – has resulted in a number of protests among migrant labourers, quelled by Kuwaiti security forces.

# Morocco 
*Answer*: 0 

*Comments*:
 'The containment measures outlined in the decrees adopted by the Moroccan authorities seem fully in compliance with the limitations imposed by the ACHPR and ICCPR on the enjoyment of these fundamental rights. In particular, they have been adopted by law, with the legitimate aim of protecting public health from a pandemic, and are both necessary and proportionate. In fact, measures limiting social contacts are not only adequate, but have proven to be the only effective measures to limit the spread of COVID-19. Moreover, the measures imposed by the Moroccan government are strictly limited (materially and in time) to the exigencies of the situation.'' (1)

# Philippines 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 There is information indicating that the measures that have been put into place because of Covid-19 has been used to discriminate in ways that cannot be justified by public health concerns. An example is listed below.

1: On April 5, volunteers in the village of Pandacaqui, in Pampanga province stopped and detained three LGBT people outside after curfew, two of whom explained they were running an errand for their grandmother. A village official accused them of looking for illicit sex and, as punishment, publicly humiliated them by ordering them to kiss, dance and do push ups on live video broadcast on social media.

# Qatar 
*Answer*: 2 

*Comments*:
 Migrants workers from Nepal were placed in detention centers and then deported after being approched by the police who said that they were going to get tested for covid-19 (detained on 12 and 13 March 2020, deported on 15 and 19 March 2020). The government responded that they were detained because of engagement in illegal and illicit activity, which Amnesty International says there is no evidence for (based on interviews and documents given to migrants). Since the government denies the measures, this is coded as major de-facto discrimination. The Doha Industrial Area, the largest migrant camp in Qatar, was placed in total lockdown after cases of covid-19 were discovered there, which is not coded since the measures may have been due to public health reasons. There are numerous reports of horrific conditions in the migrants camps (e.g. lack of access to water and poor sanitation), which were exacerbated by the pandemic but are not considered in the coding since the conditions already existed before the lockdown.

# Romania

*Comments*:
 While existing discrimination against Roma likely was exacerbated due to covid-19, I have not found any de-facto or de-jure discriminatory emergency measures. There was additional police deployment to areas with large Roma populations (Amnesty International report, p. 25), but, according to the authorities, it was due to high risk of criminality and therefore not coded.

# Saudi Arabia 
*Answer*: 2 

*Comments*:
 The Saudi Arabian government has taken several discriminating actions toward migrant workers as part of their emergency response. For example, they deported thousands of Ethiopian migrant workers during the pandemic, and as the UN reports the government argued that  "Ethiopians were vulnerable to the coronavirus and they have deported some with symptoms and many without — but no testing." Consequently, the government have deported these migrant workers not because the individuals have shown infection of Covid-19, but for being part of that group. This is then a major de facto discrimination of these migrant worker groups, and  therefore coded as 2.

# Serbia 
*Answer*: 3 

*Comments*:
 Centers of the Commissariat for Refugees and Migration for refugees, migrant and asylum-seeks were placed under 24-hour quarantine, with the exception of getting medical care. According to the Amnesty International report, “the authorities imposed a special regime, selectively targeting government operated centres housing refugees, migrants, and asylum-seekers, placing them under a strict 24-hour mandatory quarantine and deploying the military to monitor the curfew”. Additionally, the quarantine was still in place even after the state of emergency ended. Coded as 3 since it is de-jure measures (see order 512-02-9/32/2020-01) but presumably not all migrants and refugees are affected as not all of them live in government housing.

 I did not find evidence of the emergency measures discriminating "solely on the grounds of race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin".

However, with the easing of the lockdown measures, Singaporeans are now allowed to leave their homes and socialise in group not exceeding five. However, the article listed in the source shows how foreign domestic workers are asked to 
(a)	Seek consent of their employers before leaving their homes
(b)	Inform their employers about their whereabouts 
(c)	Download a contact tracing application to facilitate contact tracing and are encouraged to refrain from going out on the weekends. 

These same measures have not been enforced upon the rest of the population.

# Sri Lanka 
*Answer*: 2 

*Comments*:
 The emergency measures have been used to unfairly treat parts of the Muslim community.

1: Senior government figures have made public remarks associating the Muslim community with the Covid-19 infection. 

2: The Sri Lankan government have been prohibiting burials which are essential according to Islam. As such Muslims who have died from Covid-19 related deaths have been forcibly cremated on the instructions of the authorities and against the wishes of the deceased families. The WHO’s guidelines for the safe management of dead bodies in the context of Covid-19 allows for both burials and cremations.

*Comments*:
 The measures do not seem to discriminate de jure, but there is lack of information for whether they do so de facto. However, even the independent reporting on the measures do not mention a case like that.

# Uganda 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 The police, the army, and the Local Defense Unit (LDU) are conducting patrols in order to enforce the restrictions on movement. However, the authorities are using the enforcement of the restrictions as an excuse to crack down on the LGBTI+ community. Officers of the Ugandan Police Force raided an LGBTI+ shelter. Twenty-three residents and visitors were arbitrarily arrested and charged with engaging in a “negligent act likely to spread infection of disease”. “The charge against the shelter residents appear contradictory to the Presidential Directive on COVID-19 that essentially requires people to stay at home, this was precisely what the 23 shelter residents were doing. 
This is clearly discrimination based on sexual orientation. We interpret this as discrimination based on sex because in order to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation, one must necessarily account for the individual’s sex.

 Migrants are 
stigmatized, but not due to emergency measures put in place, rather it is civilians who fear they will bring Covid-19. Otherwise, no evidence of discrimination stemming from government covid-19 measures,  based on race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin, was found.
