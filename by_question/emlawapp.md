 It seems like even under normal times, the President has the right to issue and sign decrees without the approval of Parliament. 

''While the National People’s Assembly is suspended, the President of the Republic may legislate on urgent matters by issuing ordinances after consultation with the Council of State (the administrative court). Such ordinances issued by the President must be submitted to the legislative branch at its next session for ratification.''

Constitution 1989 (reinst. 1996, rev. 2016), article 99 (4): In addition to the powers explicitly conferred upon him by other provisions of the Constitution, the Prime Minister shall exercise the following functions:
4. he shall sign the executive decrees;

Art. 143: Matters other than those earmarked for statutory legislation shall fall within the regulatory power of the President of the Republic. The implementation of the laws shall be a matter for the regulatory field of the Prime Minister

 The Constitution (art 85, 86, 143, 144) and the Ordinance No. 17/024 of July 10, 2017 (art 63, 64) require the approval of the declaration of the state of emergency (actually its extension beyond the 30-day initial limit) by the Senate and the National Assembly, as well as a confirmation of the constitunality of the act by the Constitutional Court. 

''The ordinance proclaiming the state of emergency or the state of siege ceases to have effect after the expiration of the period provided for in the Constitution, unless the National Assembly and the Senate, seized by the President of the Republic by decision of the Council of Ministers, did not authorize its extension for successive periods of fifteen days.''

Article 85 When grave circumstances threaten, in an immediate manner, the independence or the integrity of the national territory or when they provoke the disruption of the regular functioning of the institutions, the President of the Republic proclaims a state of urgency or a state of siege after coordination with the Prime Minister and the Presidents of the two Chambers, in accordance with Articles 144 and 145 of this
Constitution.

Article 86 • 
The President of the Republic declares war by ordinance deliberated in the Council
of Ministers after the opinion of the Superior Council of Defense and the
authorization of the National Assembly and of the Senate, in accordance with Article
143 of this Constitution.

Article 144
In application of the provisions of Article 85 of this Constitution, the state of siege,
like the state of urgency, is declared by the President of the Republic.
The National Assembly and the Senate then convene of right. If they are not in
session, an extraordinary session is convoked to this effect in accordance with
Article 116 of this Constitution.
The closing of the ordinary or extraordinary sessions is[,] of right[,] delayed to
permit, as the case may be, the application of the provisions of the preceding
paragraph.
The state of urgency or the state of siege may be proclaimed for all or part of the
territory of the Republic for a time period of thirty days.
The ordinance proclaiming the state of urgency or the state of siege ceases[,] of
right[,] to produce its effects after the expiration of the time period specified in the
[fourth] paragraph of this article, unless the National Assembly and the Senate,
referred to [the matter] by the President of the Republic on decision of the Council
of Ministers, have authorized its extension for successive periods of fifteen days.
The National Assembly and the Senate can, by way of a law, end at any moment the
state of urgency or the state of siege.

Article 145
In case of a state of urgency or of state of siege, the President of the Republic takes,
by ordinances deliberated in the Council of Ministers, the measures necessary to
respond to the situation.
These ordinances are, on their signature, submitted to the Constitutional Court
which, ceasing other matters, declares if they derogate or not from this Constitution.

 The Emergency Law was agreed by a mixed group of seven MPs and seven senators, in what is known as la Commission Mixte Paritaire (CMP, “mixed equal commission”). The group also based their decisions on advice from a scientific committee. Several measures are in place to prevent any abuse of these powers on the part of the executive branch. While the president of the republic can declare a state of health emergency by decree, he/she must immediately inform the Senate and the National Assembly of the measures the executive intends to take, as well as make public the scientific data on whose basis the health emergency was declared. The Senate and National Assembly may demand any additional information they deem necessary. Additionally, a state of health emergency may be extended beyond a period of one month only by a law properly adopted by the Parliament, and any measure taken by the government during a state of health emergency may be challenged before the country’s administrative jurisdictions.

 The Government did not need parliaments approval of declaring a state of emergency, and this is therefore coded as 0.
Important to note however is that the government does need  parliament to approve any decree laws that have been issed within 60 days, and it is through these decree laws that much of the emergency measures have been taken. But the initial declaration of a state of emergency did not need parliamentary approval.

 It is a not very clear. It looks more like the Parliament does not need to authorize on a state of emergency. The Constitution mentions:
Article 73 • Should the institutions of the Republic......be interrupted, the President of the Republic takes the exceptional measures required by these circumstances, after consultation with the President of the National Assembly, President of the Senate and the President of the Constitutional Council. He informs the Nation thereof by message. Parliament meets without requiring to be convened. The end of the crisis is recognized by a message from the President of the Republic to the Nation.
And Article 74 • The President of the Republic initiates legislation concurrently with the members of Parliament. He ensures the promulgation of laws within thirty days after the law definitively adopted has been submitted to him. This period is shortened to five days in the event of an emergency.

 All the measures have a legal basis for their enavtment, and they are obliged to pass through the legislature, however, with the exception of measures related to tax reductions and generally financial cushion to Kenyan citizens, none of the other measures passed through the national assembly. The initial Covid19 measures were implmented with the Presiential Directive on March 15, while the first legal provisions and piece of legislation came later: THE PUBLIC HEALTH (PREVENTION, CONTROL AND SUPPRESSION OF COVID-19) RULES, 2020 - ARRANGEMENT OF REGULATIONS, by the legal notice n.49 on 3rd April 2020, and the PUBLIC ORDER ACT (legal notice n.36, March 25), and even this legislation did not get the approval of the parliament.

# Lesotho 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 Coded as 1 because although the declaration does not need approval, the extension of a state of emergency needs to be approved by Parliament.

''...the Prime Minister has the power to declare the state of emergency without the approval of Parliament. However, only Parliament has the power to extend such a declaration from the initial 14 days. The problem in Lesotho is that the state of emergency was declared at a time when Parliament was prorogued. This means that there was no constitutional authority to extend the state of emergency beyond the 14 days that the Prime Minister is allowed to establish. Realizing this constitutional reality, on 15 April 2020, the Prime Minister re-declared the state of emergency from 15 April 2020 to 28 April 2020. Whilst this was legally correct under those circumstances, it does raise questions about the legal position that persisted between 8 April and 15 April 2020. Was there a state of emergency during this period? Were the things done or enforced during this period constitutionally sanctioned? The answers to some of these or other questions remain unclear and may never be found.

 According to Article 200 of the Constitution, a decision to declare a state of emergency is made by the parliament but "when the decision on the state of emergency has not been passed by the National Assembly, the National Assembly shall verify it within 48 hours from its passing, that is, as soon as it is in a position to convene." The approval of the state of emergency was made on 29 April 2020 by the parliament, following the first plenary session after the state of emergency was declared on 28 April, therefore coded as 1. The Steering Committee of the Serbian Bar Association argues that the declaration of the state of emergency was declared unconstitutionally and "the decision of the President of the Republic, the Speaker of the National Assembly and the Prime Minister to declare a state of emergency does not contain a rationale behind such decision, which makes it impossible to determine whether the conditions for the application of Article 200(5) of the Constitution of the Republic of Serbia have been met, i.e. whether there was a reason why the National Assembly was unable to meet".

 The National Disaster Management Act (2002) does not require that the National Assembly approve the declaration of the national state of disaster, its end date, or its extension. These powers belong solely to the executive. However, petitions can be brought before the courts to repeal the measure.

 Turkey has used a varied set of existing legal instruments to implement emergency response (e.g.  The Law on the Protection of Public Health (Law no.1593) and the Law on Provincial Administration (Law no.5442)), and there is therefore no single legal instrument to highlight here.

 The National Emergency Act states that: "With respect to Acts of Congress authorizing the exercise, during the period of a national emergency, of any special or extraordinary power, the President is authorized to declare such national emergency." The President therefore needs no approval from Congress to declare a national emergency.

 According to the law, the National Assembly doesn't need to approve the declaration but shoud approve the extension of the 'Estado de Alarma'. Since it does not recognize Maduro as president, the decree to extend it was considered constitutional by the Venezuelan Supreme Court.
