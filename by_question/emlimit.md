# Austria 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 The officially declared time limit for the Covid-19 Law, the main legal instrument, is 31 december 2020. Any regulations produced within the Covid-19 Law therefore ends at this date, if not having been ended earlier. The measures taken within the Covid-19 Law and Second Covid-19 Law vary a lot in terms of their time limits, whether a time limit has been set and how and how fast measures will be taken to ease restrictions. Consequently, many of the emergency measures taken under the legal instrument have earlier time limits, and the overall response also has a time limit in that the legislation is terminated at December 31, and this is therefore coded as 1.

 'Because the declaration of the state of health alert was made by "an oral communication", we could not find material elements of temporal limitation of this state. But according to article 66, the measures taken under this state must be limited in time. Indeed, according to article 66, "compulsory hygiene and prophylaxis measures are applied during a determined period and renewable if necessary"....Materially, the declaration of health alert as announced is unlimited in its form. The declaration of the state of health alert should be limited in time, which would ensure a comfortable reading between the declaration and the measures taken in application of this declaration, which, meanwhile, are limited in duration with the possibility of extension.''

*Comments*:
 Under Art 154 of Egypt’s 2014 constitution, the president with parliamentary approval can declare a state of emergency for up to three months, with three-month extensions if approved by two-thirds of parliament. In this sense, there is an officially declared time limit. However, the current 596-member parliament is tightly controlled by intelligence agencies and dominated by the al-Sisi’s supporters. It has acted largely as a rubber stamp for his policies with almost no opposition.

 The Imposition of Restrictions Act (2020) allows for restrictions to be declared "for a period of not more than three months" but also allows the president to extend these restrictions for "not more than one month at a time but in any event for not more than three months" (Article 4). The president initially imposed restrictions on movement, gatherings, and travel for two to three weeks. He has invoked the right and extended the provisions on several occasions, most recently 15 June 2020. Presently, according to E.I. 64 of 15 March, the main emergency provisions under the restrictions act are set to expire on 31 July.

 Decree 40/2020 had a 15-day end limit, its extension (Law T/9790) by parliament had no end limit. Although the state of emergency ended on 17 June 2020, coded as 0 since there was no end limit at the time of passing.

# Israel 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 Article 38 of the Israeli constitution, Declaring a State of Emergency, states that the Knesset can declare a state of emergency for a maximum time limit of one year (with possibility of extension), and that the government can declare a state of emergency with the maximum time limit of 7 days (with the possiblity of extension, and the possible termination of the state of the emergency if the Knesset votes in favour of ending it). This state of emergency is the latter, declared by the government, and thus had an initial time limit of 7 days although they have extended it afterwards.

# Ivory Coast 
*Answer*: 0 

*Comments*:
 In the Decree 2020-351 du 23 mars, 2020 whis declared a state of emergency, it mentions that this measure may be renewed if necessary, no limit date.  
All the sources also mention that the President did not specify the duration of these new measures.
In the Law of 1969 on the state of emergency, it states that the decree declaring a state of emergency should specify its duration, but it does not do so.

In another source it mentions that ''The health alert system is maintained until the end of 2020.'', but it is unclear if that differs from the state of emergency.

# Lesotho 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 The Constitution of Lesotho limits a state of emergency to 14 days, unless authorized by the legislature, which may allow for a period of no more than six-months. The legislature refused to approve a measure that would have extended the state of emergency beyond the initial 14 day period allowed for in the constitution. At that time, it had been suspended by the prime minister. Later the constitutional court ruled the suspension of parliament unconstitutional. It has since been reinstated and the prime minister resigned.

# Malawi 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 The Disaster Preparedness and Relief Act allows for an initial state of disaster to last for three months and to be extended for another three months. President Mutharika initially announced a 30-day period for the state of disaster. Later, on 01 April, the government invoked the Public Health Act to issue the Public Health (Corona Virus Prevention, Containment, and Management) Rules on 08 April. However, the 21-day lockdown proposed in these rules was halted by the High Court of Malawi on 17 April 2020. We code the official end date based on the initial 30-day period for the state of disaster because we could find no evidence of its extension.

 Article 14, law 2017 055 of November 6, 2017 mentions that the state of emergency can be announced for maximum one month, and then renewed only once for the same time: 
''Le décret instituant l’état d’urgence peut par une disposition expresse, conférer à l’autorité administrative compétente le pouvoir de prononcer l’internement administratif des personnes dont l’activité présente un danger pour la sécurité publique. Cette mesure peut être prononcée pour une durée maximum d’un (1) mois, renouvelable une seule fois pour une période égale.''

However, I haven't found any source indicating a limit date to the state of emergency.

# Poland 
*Answer*: 0 

*Comments*:
 The official statement announcing the state of epidemic says the state is in force until cancellation (based on order 491 from 20 March 2020, chapter 1, point 1). I found no time limit on the duration of the state of epidemic and the emergency measures in the order declaring a state of epidemic (Order 491 from 20 March 2020, http://www.dziennikustaw.gov.pl/D2020000049101.pdf). The emergency measures that apply for the duration of the state of epidemic are covid-19 related measures such as restrictions on movement (border crossing and similar) (Chapter 2), Restrictions or prohibitions on the marketing and use of certain items (masks, disinfectant and similar) (Chapter 3),  Restrictions on the functioning of certain institutions or workplaces (Chapter 4) , Prohibition of organizing shows and other gatherings of the population (Chapter 5), access to real estate, premises and areas provided for by anti-epidemic plans (Chapter 6). 

The state of epidemic was declared based on “the Act on specific solutions related to the prevention and combating COVID and other infectious diseases and crises they caused” (from 7 March 2020, http://dziennikustaw.gov.pl/D2020000037401.pdf), which amended “Act on preventing and combating infections and infectious diseases” (5 December 2008). According to Article 36 of the Act from 7 March, Articles 3-6 (on remote work, additional care allowance, airport regulations and procurement) and Articles 10-14 (on central government’s authority to give orders to local governments, changes to construction, tourism and transportation industries) a 180-day time limit and Article 31 (on budget transfers) has a 365-day time limit. The rest of the provisions (related to the “functioning of the health care system, telecommunication or state's Sanitary and Epidemiological Stations”, https://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra_uploads/poland-report-covid-19-april-2020_en.pdf) amend existing regulations and are permanent changes to the “Act on preventing and combating infections and infectious diseases”.

The state of epidemic is also different from the state of emergency that has a 90-day time limit based on the Constitution (Article 230, point 1). While some specific emergency measures under a state of epidemic have a time limit, the state of epidemic was declared until further notice, therefore coded as 0.
