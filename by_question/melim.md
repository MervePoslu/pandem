# Algeria 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 'Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, the government of Algeria headed by newly elected President Abdelmadjid Tebboune approved a bill amending the country’s penal code to criminalize the spreading of “false news” that harms national unity. The sweeping new law gives authorities powers to tackle misinformation about the virus, but also opens the door to possible censorship. Penalties range between two to five years in jail and carry fines of up to €3,600.''

LAW 20-06 AMENDING THE PENAL CODE - 
The amendments increase prison sentences for defamation, and introduce new penalties including prison sentences for the dissemination of false information. Under the amendments, new offenders face prison sentences of between one and three years. In addition, penalties are heightened if the offence takes place “at a time of a public health lockdown or a natural, biological or technological catastrophe or any other form of catastrophe,” with first time offenders facing up to five years in prison

The Algerian governmen, in an attempt to curb the very real dangers caused by dis- and misinformation disseminated by conspiracy theorists and fabulists has been to pass a new law criminalising the broadcast of “fake news” deemed harmful to “public order and state security”. The law, approved by parliament on 22 April, 2020, has come in for criticism by free speech activists, who point out that it could be used to curb independent reporting of the government’s failings in tackling the pandemic. These deficiencies, such as the lack of adequate preventative measures in hospitals, have prompted some doctors to post videos on social media in which they draw attention to the difficult circumstances they are working under. The new law could be used to suppress such reports.''

 The Decree 4200 article 13 state that "People who incite non-compliance with this Supreme Decree or misinform or generate uncertainty for the population, will be subject to criminal charges for the commission of crimes against public health". Amnesty International, HRW and Civicus argue that this measure threatens freedom of expression. There is no evidence that it has been used to limit media freedom, but there are accusations that it is being used to persecue political adversaries.

# Burma/Myanmar 
*Answer*: 0 

*Comments*:
 The emergency measures do not place de jure limitations on media, but Myanmar has previous de jure limitations on media that has been used to restrict reporting on Covid-19. Article 505 of the Penal Code states that spreading information that "cause fear or alarm to the public" is illegal and can result in prison up to two years. This, however, is not a part of the emergency response and was in place before the Covid-19 crisis, and no sources state that Myanmar has introduced any new de jure limitations since then, so this is coded as 0.

# Egypt 
*Answer*: 2 

*Comments*:
 Emergency measures that have been in place since 2017 do restrict media freedom in multiple ways. The restrictions include 
1: Requiring online newspapers to register for permits to continue publishing.
2: Requiring media outlets to deposit sums (depending on the type of media) to bank accounts. The sums are high and act as deterrents to independent outlets.
3: The Supreme Council for Media Regulation has the power to block or suspend personal accounts if it decides that they are publishing or broadcasting fake news.
4: Art 3 of the State of Emergency Law 1958 states that once the state of emergency is imposed, the President has the right to put limitations on fundamental freedoms, including freedom of movement, assembly, residence and traffic in certain places or times. The same article allows for the surveillance of all forms of “correspondence” and expression, including newspapers and other publications before publication, and the power to shut down publication houses and confiscate materials for “public safety or issues of national security”.
5: Recently, the authorities have also warned that those who spread ‘false news’ about the coronavirus may face up to five years imprisonment and steep fines.

# Iran 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 Reporters without borders report that: "The Covid-19 National Management Office (the government body set up to combat the coronavirus) and the press department of the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance have issued a communiqué announcing that “no newspapers will be printed until further notice.” Officially, this is to ensure respect for the government’s social distancing measures, because 'the distribution of printed newspapers and magazines requires physical interaction between individuals, journalists, printers and distributers, and this interaction could potentially facilitate the spread of the virus.'".
This is thus a part of the national emergency response, and a de jure limitation on the media by banning all printed media. However, as it does not hinder them from publishin news online, it does not count as a major de jure limitation, and is therefore coded as 1.

# Jordan 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 As part of the emergency measures, the government has suspended all printed media as they argue it would increase the spread of the virus. Furthermore, a decree has been issued under the state of emergency that states that sharing news that could "cause panic" about the pandemic is punishable with up to three years in prison. This decree, and banning printed media (although they are still allowed to publish online), constitutes a de jure limitation to media. However, no detailed account of this decree has been found, and it is unclear whether it strictly limits some disinformation on the pandemic or more broadly limits media freedom (although de facto limitations on media freedom are prevalent). This is therefore coded as 1, as no direct evidence of the de jure limitations being more far reaching has been found.

# Laos 
*Answer*: 3 

*Comments*:
 The decree that regulates the emergency measures states that the government shall "strictly prohibit the advertisement of, release, forward any fake news via any media platform that can cause misunderstanding, panic and create negative impact on society. Task the agency for surveillance and response to the social complaints to closely monitor and strictly take action on those offenders." (Section 6). The decree also states that "the Task Force Committee shall provide detail guidance in a format of an easy understanding to disseminate through official media outlets" (Section 11).
Consequently, the decree makes it punishable to report in any way on anything deemed to cause misunderstanding, panic and negative impact on the society, without any definition on what this constitutes. Furthermore, it regulates which media outlets shall report on the Covid-19 situation and government response. This is therefore coded as 3 - the emergency measure de jure require that all or almost all media reporting on Covid-19 reflect the governments position.

# Liberia

*Comments*:
 On April 29, 
Liberia’s solicitor general said that the government would shut down news outlets and seize equipment from journalists alleged to have disseminated “fake news.” Also, media are forced to suspend printing due to lockdown restrictions, thus limiting their reach.

Also, the Liberian constitution, article 15a: "Every person shall have the right to freedom of expression ... save during an emergency declared" Article 86a: "...the President may suspend or affect certain rights, freedoms and guarantees..." But the measures themselves have been argued to explicitly target fake news and violations of lockdown.

# Madagascar 
*Answer*: 3 

*Comments*:
 The text of the Law  n ° 91-011 of July 18, 1991 relating to exceptional situations, mentions:
Art. 17 - The proclamation of the emergency situation automatically confers on the President of the Republic the power, by regulatory means:
                6. To take all measures to ensure the control of the press of publications and broadcasts of all kinds and to prohibit those which are likely to disturb public order or endanger national unity;

The Decree N ° 2020 –359 of March 21, 2020 proclaiming a state of health emergency, mentions:
Article 4.- The Minister of National Defense...... the Minister of Posts, Telecommunications and Digital Development, the Minister of Communication and Culture,......are each responsible as far as he is concerned, of the execution of this decree.

''...the Malagasy authorities have taken some of the most restrictive measures for the media in Africa. Radio stations and television channels are obliged to broadcast official information on the coronavirus, under penalty of sanction. This directive should not be subject to any restriction on the information that the media may publish according to the Minister of Communication. Free-to-air programs giving voice to listeners were also banned as part of the state of health emergency.''

The Madagascan authorities, responding to accusations of restricitng media freedoms (see more on this on the following media variables), said:

"The press is one of the services that are automatically requisitioned"
If Madagascan journalists are worried about this tense context, the Minister of Communication wants to clarify the situation. "There is absolutely no restriction of their freedom of expression per se, but - it is true and we assume it, because that is the law which authorizes and which says it - the press is part of the services that are requisitioned as part of a state of emergency , justifies Lalatiana Rakotondrazafy. So we ask all the media in Madagascar to disseminate information on everything related to the coronavirus without asking them for any restriction in the information they can publish."

(original in French: « La presse fait partie des services qui sont réquisitionnés d'office »
Si les journalistes malgaches s'inquiètent de ce contexte tendu, la ministre de la Communication veut clarifier la situation. « Il n'y a absolument pas de restriction de leur liberté d'expression en soi, mais - c'est vrai et nous l'assumons, parce que ça c'est la loi qui l'autorise et qui le dit - la presse fait partie des services qui sont réquisitionnés d'office dans le cadre d'un état d'urgence, justifie Lalatiana Rakotondrazafy. Donc on demande à tous les médias de Madagascar de diffuser les informations sur tout ce qui tourne autour du coronavirus sans pour autant leur demander une quelconque restriction dans les informations qu'ils peuvent publier. »

# Mongolia 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 On April 29, Mongolia amended the Law on Administrative Offenses to include a paragraph stating that: ”Misleading the public or disseminating false information in the event of a disaster, catastrophe, communicable disease, accident or danger shall be punishable by a fine of 500 togrogs for a person or 5,000 togrogs for a legal person unless criminally punishable” (Section 5.13.1). As the current pandemic is regarded such a case of crisis, a person can be punished with fines if "disseminating false information” on the crisis. However, no other de jure limitations on media have been found in Mongolias emergency response. Therefore, this is coded as 1 - a de jure limitation on media restricted to making some limitations on the reporting on Covid-19.

# Russia 
*Answer*: 2 

*Comments*:
 Based on amendments to Article 207 of Criminal Code from 31 March 2020 ( № 100-ФЗ), dissemination of "false information" can be punished with a fine or jail sentence, which IPI argues is a "fake news" law that can be used to limit freedom of the media. According to the Council of Europe, "Media organisations will face fines of up to 5 million rubles (€62,000), that may rise up to 10 million rubles (€124,000) for repeated offences. Individuals will face criminal prosecution that may lead to severe financial penalties (e.g. fines equivalent to the person’s total income over the last 18 months) and prison sentences for up to 5 years."

 While there hasn’t been measures on media freedom with regards to journalists and mainstream media, the Acting Inspector General (IGP) instructed the police to take legal action against those who publish posts on social media criticising government officials and obstructing their duties. The police have not indicated under what legal provision these actions will be taken. The police reportedly arrested more than seven individuals in the week after this order came into place. As of April 17 the police had reportedly arrested 17 individuals ‘for spreading false information’ about COVID-19. None of these people were journalists.

# Thailand 
*Answer*: 2 

*Comments*:
 Authorities have been using both the Emergency Decree and Computer-Related Crime Act’s “anti-fake news” provisions to shut down criticism from the media about the government’s response to the pandemic.

In March, the government issues a list of prohibitions under the state of emergency, including vague restrictions on press freedom that can be enforced by prosecution: “Reporting or spreading of information regarding COVID-19 which is untrue and may cause public fear, as well as deliberate distortion of information which causes misunderstanding and hence affects peace and order, or good moral of people, are prohibited.” 

This information is obtained from Human Rights Watch. I have not been able to read the actual list of prohibitions as the entire document is in Thai and an English translation has not been made. The link to the prohibtions (in thai) has been added to the sources.

# Turkey 
*Answer*: 0 

*Comments*:
 There are no reports found that any of the emergency measures places any de jure limitations on media. While media freedom is heavily restricted in Turkey, and harassment is on-going during the pandemic, there are no reports that any de jure limitations have been imposed as a part of Covid-19 measures, or during the pandemic.

 It is prohibited to spread rumors or false information about the Covid-19 virus. The government will fine people up to 20,000 dirhams ($5,500) if they share medical information about the coronavirus that contradicts official statements. The aim is to counter "fake news". 

Also, the National Media Council has decided to stop the distribution of all print newspapers, magazines and marketing material. 

No more severe de-jure media limitations were found.

 I did not find any information related to this. But  a new decree was introduced in Vietnam on 15 April 2020 introducing fines for the dissemination of ‘fake news’ or rumours on social media. According to the decree, fines are imposed on people who use social media to share false, untruthful, distorted or slanderous information.

# Zambia 
*Answer*: 0 

*Comments*:
 The production of "fake news" is prohibited in Zambia since before the Covid-19 crisis, and will thus not be included in this score as it is not part of the current emergency measures. No evidence that the covid-19 emergency measures de-jure limit media freedom was been found.
