*Comments*:
 Many measures have been lifted since June7 and  June 14, but the general ones remain in place.

''The Algerian government announced on Saturday, June 13, that restrictions introduced due to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak will be further eased from Sunday, June 14. Curfew measures will be ended in the following provinces: El Bayadh, Ain Defla, Gharda√Øa, Guelma, Illizi, Jijel, Mila, Mostaganem, Naama, Saida, Skikda, Tamanrasset, El Tarf, Tebessa, Ain Temouchent, Tiaret, Tindouf, Tizi-Ouzou, and Tlemcen. In the remaining 29 provinces, which includes Algiers, the curfew will now run on a shorter timeframe from between 20:00 and 05:00 (local time).''

''On Sunday, June 7, Algerian authorities eased restrictions enacted to limit the spread of COVID-19. During this first phase of easing, several industries were permitted to resume operations, including plumbers, painters, travel agents, fast food restaurants (take-away only), and art galleries.''

''All land borders remain closed and non-cargo international air and maritime travel, as well as domestic flights, are suspended. Public spaces including schools, universities, and mosques also remain closed.''

 Belgium began phasing out lockdown measures at the beginning of May, marking out 4, 11 and 18 May, as well as 8 June, as key dates. By June 8, the measures were weakened, but there are still some restrictions in place - i.e. large gatherings are still prohibited.

# El Salvador 
*Answer*: 2020-06-15 

*Comments*:
 The state of emergency was declared on 2020-03-14 for 30 days (legislative decree n 593), extended on 2020-04-12 for 4 days (legislative decree 622), extended on 2020-04-16 for 15 days (legislative decree 631) and extended on 2020-04-30 for 15 days (legislative decree 634). Then, the president tried to extend it on 2020-05-16 for 30 days via executive decree 18, but the decree was considered inconstitutional by the supreme court and suspended on 2020-05-18, because it did not have legislative approval. The president insisted on declaring a new state of emergency and after a few days of debate between the executive and the legislative, the legislative decree 648 from 2020-05-30 declared state of emergency for another 15 days and defined guidelines for reopening the country.

 The Imposition of Restrictions Act (2020) allows for restrictions to be declared "for a period of not more than three months" but also allows the president to extend these restrictions for "not more than one month at a time but in any event for not more than three months" (Article 4). The president has thus far invoked this right and extended the provisions on several occasions.

 According to the Disaster and Preparedness and Emergency Management Act 2015, Section 26: 
"(3) An order under subsection (2) shall remain in force until the end of the period specified therein." The different regulations have end dates, there is no specific date for when the stat eof disaster expires.  I have also not found evidence of it being lifted/expired to date.

*Comments*:
 The legislature refused to approve a measure that would have extended the state of emergency beyond the initial 14 day period allowed for in the constitution. At that time, it had been suspended by the prime minister. Later the constitutional court ruled the suspension of parliament unconstitutional. It has since been reinstated and the prime minister resigned.

"The Ministry of Justice has clarified that the June 9 date contained in the Executive Mansion press release as the stipulated date ending the state of emergency was an error. ... the effective date of the commencement of the 60-day state of emergency was April 21, therefore, the official expiration would be June 21, contrary to the June 9 mentioned in the Executive Mansion press release."

# Malawi 
*Answer*: 2020-04-20 

*Comments*:
 The Disaster Preparedness and Relief Act allows for an initial state of disaster to last for three months and to be extended for another three months. President Mutharika initially announced a 30-day period for the state of disaster. Later, on 01 April, the government invoked the Public Health Act to issue the Public Health (Corona Virus Prevention, Containment, and Management) Rules on 08 April. However, the 21-day lockdown proposed in these rules was halted by the High Court of Malawi on 17 April 2020. We code the end of the initial 30-day period for the state of disaster because we could find no evidence of its extension.

 Measures taken under Article 60 Constitution are still in place: On June 15th, the Mauritanian Government decides to extend curfew time, 8:00: p.m until 6:00 a.m, for additional two weeks.
However, many are lifted: On May 6, the Mauritanian Government decided to open markets and restaurants with some conditions including social distancing, putting face masks and other protective measures.
Also, Mosques in Mauritania reopened on May 10 after a week of no new coronavirus cases were recorded. Authorities allowed mosques to open for prayer, but called on worshippers to respect social distancing and wear masks ‚Äì a call which seems to have been largely ignored.

# Tunisia 

*Answer:* *No answer entered* 

*Comments*:
 Per law, powers by article 70 can only last max 
2 months, so it should be lifted today, but no indication of that at time of coding. Article 80 has no time limit unless the parliament wants to challenge the necessity of it.

No evidence of either article 70 or 80 being inactivated, has been found.

 Sections 11 and 27 in the "Public Health Act 1935" do not mention an time limit or sunset clause. Section 14 in the "Public Health (Control of COVID-19) Rules, 2020" states that "These Rules shall expire on notification by the Minister." The Public Health Act section 11 and 27 are still active and, according to the Uganda Legal Information Institute, the Public Health Rules 2020 are still in force.

*Comments*:
 The Civil Protection Act, section 27:2: "The declaration of a state of disaster in terms of subsection (1) shall remain in force for a period of three months ‚Ä¶ the President may, from time to time, by statutory instrument, extend such declaration". The state of disaster has not been found to no longer be in effect, and the measures, such as lockdown, are extended for an indefinite period. Thus, it seems the state of disaster is still in effect.
