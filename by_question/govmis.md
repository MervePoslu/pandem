# Belarus 
*Answer*: 2

 Repeated advice from the President on ways to treat covid-19 by going to the sauna, working the fields, and drinking, which is contrary to WHO statement that "there are no medicines that have been shown to prevent or cure the disease." (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses) and reference to lockdowns as “psychosis”. The President also decided to host a military parade on 9 May despite WHO's recommendations against it (https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/05/06/belaruss-parade-plans-defy-public-health-recommendations). Coded as 2 since information provided by the Ministry of Health is in line with WHO recommendations.

# Burma/Myanmar 
*Answer*: 0 

*Comments*:
 There are widespread reports that Myanmar has misreported the number of Covid-19 cases and deaths, but no sources have been found that state that the government has produced disinformation on Covid-19 itself. Myanmar has a webpage with numerous documents on Covid-19 and information for the public, but these are all in Burmese and Google Translate isn't able to translate this well enough for those documents to be examined. This is coded as 0, as no direct evidence of disinformation has been found, but note that the documents produced by the government has not been assessed.

# Burundi 
*Answer*: 3 

*Comments*:
 Burundi has issued guidlines on protective measures against covid19 which are more or less in line with WHO (not very detailed), but:

''Government officials in...,...Burundi,.....have exhibited disturbing denialism about COVID-19, depriving their publics of accurate information on the pandemic.''
In an interview with BBC, Jean-Claude Karerwa Ndenzako, the spokesperson for the President of Burundi, told the BBC why the country is so far spared by Covid-19.
''BBC. Does this mean that Burundi would still be spared from the Coronavirus pandemic thanks to its unparalleled love for God?

This I confirm and attest! But we are not saying that the epidemic cannot happen in Burundi. That is why we have prepared ourselves accordingly, but also according to the current situation in our country. But whether you believe it or not, Burundi is a country that has signed a special pact with God.''

Also, Burundi expelled the World Health Organization’s expert team working on coronavirus. ''Days before its May 20 election, Burundi has expelled an expert World Health Organization (WHO) team from the country, according to a foreign ministry letter obtained by the Associated Press. The team includes the WHO’s top country official, its country coronavirus coordinator, its head of communicable diseases for the country, and a laboratory expert focused on COVID-19 testing. The letter did not offer an explanation for the ousting.''

There is thus no indication that the government distributes any disinformation on the virus based on this. Furthermore, the American Embassy in Kuwait has not made any accusations of disinformation, and  are recommending people to take part of the Kuwaiti governments information on Covid-19.

 Laos has launched a website with all information on Covid-19, but this is not accessible. No reports of disinformation on Covid-19 by the Laos authorities has been indicated bu other sources, but as the published information on it is not available, this conclusion is very tentative.

# Madagascar 
*Answer*: 2 

*Comments*:
 The government has been distributing for free a so-called cure for the coronavirus, going against WHO guidlines.

''On 20 April, President Andry Rajoelina himself launched Covid-Organics (CVO), an “improved traditional remedy with curative and preventive properties” against the coronavirus, as he described it.
Officially developed by the Malagasy Institute of Applied Research (IMRA), the remedy is an infusion derived from artemisia and other plants which remain secret. It comes in the form of a liquid or infusion, with a defined dosage....The remedy’s discovery has also pushed authorities to ease lockdown restrictions.''

Other than that, the ministry of health's website provides accurate information on covid19 - how it spreads, what to do to protect against it etc.

 Lopez Obrador said in March about covid-19: “According to the information that is available, it is not something terrible, fatal. It is not even equivalent to flu.'; that "it would not affect Mexico"; and that "people should still go out". He shared a video on twitter of himself hugging and shaking hands of supporters, ignoring recomendations of health autorities. When asked what he was doing to protect himself from the virus, the president showed he was carrying images of religious figures to protect against diseases. However, the Ministry of Health and local governments are disseminating information in accordance with the WHO.

# Mongolia 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 Most of the information provided by the Mongolian government on Covid-19 is in line with WHO, such as how it spreads, what the symptoms are, who's most at risk if catching it and some of the guidelines for how to avoid it and mitigate the spread. However, they also include a set of advice on how to avoid catching it and what to do if you contract it that is not in line with WHO. These include that avoiding Covid-19 is more likely if one "Drink warm liquids frequently and use cups with lids, Rinse mouth and throat with lukewarm water with salt, lemon and soda, Get a good night's sleep, Calm and stress free, and, Do not use elevators on floors 1-5". Furthermore, it's stated that to avoid contracting it, elderly should among other things "Eat low-salt, sugary, and low-fat foods, Drink hot, warm liquids frequently, Get a good night's sleep, and Calm, no stress, no fatigue".
As these are misleading statements that are not in accordance with WHO, but are presented together with correct information, and does not counter the content of those approved guidelines and infromation, this is coded as 1.
Note also, that all these quotes are taken from using google translate on the Mongolian website on Covid-19.

 Ortega said the coronavirus "is a sign that God," who does not want governments "to spend billions of dollars on atomic bombs, on military bases and alliances." The Panamerican Health Organization (afiliated with the WHO) says there is community transmission in Nicaragua, but the government denies it. Government members do not wear masks in public and criticize people who self-isolate saying it is a "radical" measure.

 The Nigerian government is importing a herbal "miracle medicine" from Madagascar, which has been advised by the WHO not to cure Covid-19. However, contrary to several other countries that import the herbal drink, Nigerian officials and the president say the drink will be subjected to strict clinical testing for verification of its effect before it's released to the public. Based on the testing decision, importing this drink is not included in the score.

Otherwise, the government Covid-19 information is similar to that of the WHO.

# North Korea 
*Answer*: 0 

*Comments*:
 North Korea has also claimed that it has not had a single case of Covid-19. However, experts find this hard to believe given the country’s proximity to China and South Korea – both countries that have been hit hard by the pandemic. There has also been one report of a North Korean who was shot while attempting to defect to China on 20 April 2020. He was transported to a hospital in Longjing, Jilin province and was later tested to positive for Covid-19. However, this case was only reported by one news outlet, the Daily NK. It is an online newspaper focusing on issues relating to North Korea and is based in South Korea.

# Syria 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 The problem seems to be the lack of information that has been disseminated. The regime initially issued some basic facts and recommendations that were in line with the WHO guidlines, but not detailed at all, and also there are many who claim that the regime has not paid much attention is safeguarding the safety of the people, or shown signs that it takes the situation seriously.

# Tajikistan 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 The government publishes information on covid-19 on the health ministry website (http://moh.tj/covid-19/). In March 2020, the health minister gave an interview to a state-run newspaper saying that covid-19 is less likely to spread in Tajikistan due to its hot climate. The government also held traditional Nowruz celebrations with 12,000 people in March (https://www.economist.com/asia/2020/04/23/life-carries-on-as-usual-in-tajikistan-and-turkmenistan). Coded as 1 since information on the official website is in line with WHO recommendations.

# Tanzania 
*Answer*: 2 

*Comments*:
 The president says that Covid-19 is the devil, and says it is because of all the prayers of the citizens that Tanzania is now free of it. However, the US embassy advised that all available evidence pointed to exponential growth of Covid-19 cases in several locations in Tanzania. And the WHO have not received data from Tanzania in line with the presidents claims. 
The president also promises to import a tonic from Madagascar as a cure for Covid-19, while the WHO advises that this will not kill the virus.

# The Gambia 
*Answer*: 2 

*Comments*:
 The information from the government is similar to the information from WHO. However, Gambia has announced accepting a consignment from the Madagascar’s president. The "Covid Organics" medicine (a herbal tonic touted as a cure for COVID-19) was then said to be handed to the ministry of health for treatment of patients. WHO, advises that there is no proof of its efficiency.

# United States of America 
*Answer*: 2 

*Comments*:
 The Atlantic has provides a list inaccurate statements about Covid-19 by the President (with reference to where the original statement was made), and why they are wrong. For example, the President has stated that it would disappear come warmer weather, that it would simply disappear due to a miracle ("One day it's like a miracle - it will simply disappear"), that  vaccines will be available much earlier than any other sources claim, that antimalaria medicine is an effective treatment for the virus, that injecting disinfectants could be used as a treatment against the virus, and that many medical staff are using antimalaria medicine/injecting disinfectants as a way of protecting themselves against the virus. All these are, by the governments own agencies, the WHO as well as numerous other sources, deemed inaccurate.
Many of the claims have also been repeated, and when questioned, the president have defended many of them.
However, government agencies and agents, most prominently the CDC, have also provided information fully in accordance with WHO, and have also contested many of  the presidents claims. It can therefore not be regarded a systematic dissemination of information about the virus from the government and its agencies as a whole, but rather a mixed and conflicting message where the president often has provided information on the virus that is not in accordance with WHO. The variable is therefore coded as 2.
