*Comments*:
 Except for the new law amending the Penal code and criminalizing the spread of ''fake news'', ''One journalist, Khaled Drareni, an editor at the Algerian publication, the Casbah Tribune, was arrested for allegedly "inciting an unarmed gathering and endangering national unity" over his critical Covid-19 coverage. In the past, Drareni had been arrested for his coverage of anti-government protests which had been staged every Friday for more than a year, before it was stopped because of Covid-19.''

# Burma/Myanmar 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 Myanmar has used Article 505 of the Penal code, which states that spreading information that ”cause fear or alarm to the public” is punishable with up to two years in prison, to arrest and jail a journalist reporting on Covid-19, as well as having closed down over 200 websites by claiming that they have spread ”fake news”. As the regulation in use allows for any arbitrary interpretation of ”fear or alarm to the public”, and media outlets online are being closed down, this is deemed a de facto limitation on reporting on the governments response to Covid-19, as doing so risks both being arrested under the penal code and/or being closed down due to spreading fake news.

# Burundi 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 There are widepread reports on lack of transparency from the Burundian authoritiies on covid19 related matters.

''A health ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said seven patients had gone to one hospital with symptoms such as respiratory distress and that a whole wing had been dedicated to them ata military hospital. A doctor, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, reported six deaths of patients “presenting all the symptoms of coronavirus” last week.''

''The UN Commission noted that some humanitarian organisations were refused access to sites where persons were quarantined in deplorable conditions. The quarantined persons should be provided with sufficient food, clean water and access to health facilities and medical services.''

''Human Rights Watch on Tuesday criticized the Burundian government’s performance in dealing with the coronavirus pandemic, accusing it of having a “denial and deflection approach to crisis management”.''
'' “On March 27, a hospital in Bujumbura, the country’s economic capital, alerted the government to three strongly suspected cases, who later reportedly tested negative. Several sources in the medical and humanitarian field have expressed concerns to Human Rights Watch that the authorities are not conducting enough tests to understand the extent to which the disease may be spreading,” said the statement.''

Also, the outgoing president of Burundi has died of a sudden illness, suspected by many to be Covid-19. The cause of Pierre Nkurunziza’s death was described as a heart attack in a government statement....It was unclear exactly when he died. A government statement said the president, a keen sports enthusiast, had attended a game of volleyball on Saturday but fell ill that night and was taken to hospital.''

 There has been restrictions on the government’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic.

2: In March, security forces arrested an Egyptian journalist for questioning official statistics in relation to the spread of COVID-19 on his personal Facebook page. He was held at an undisclosed location without any contact with the outside world for nearly a month before being brought in front of prosecutors to face accusations of “spreading false news” and “joining a terrorist organization”.

3: Doctors and pharmacists have been arrested for speaking out against the government’s response to the virus.

 Besides de-jure measure, according to RSF: "Salvadorean journalists and media outlets have also reported being unable to get information from health professionals about difficulties in the provision of protective equipment or reliable figures for confirmed coronavirus cases and deaths."

There are also several reports of security forces interferring with journalists reporting on coronavirus.

# Indonesia 
*Answer*: 0 

*Comments*:
 There have not been government placed de-facto limitations on media reporting. However, On April 4, 2020, the National Police Headquarter issued a Telegram Letter instructing the police on the handling of “hoax spreaders” and any act of insult to the President and his administration during the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the police authority, this telegram letter is officially aimed at maintaining the security and order of the community. The telegram ordered the police force to carry out cyber patrols to monitor developments in cyberspace and to counter criminal acts to provide a deterrent effect. 

So far, there have been at least 53 people accused of spreading “false news” and insulting the President and his administration related to COVID-19. There are concerns on the possibility of criminalization towards more people who spread “false and misleading” information as well as criticize the Government’s response to COVID-19.

 There are several reports on journalists being arrested for reporting on the coronavirus, especially those who have published evidence that contradicts the governments figures about the spread of the virus and accused the Iranian government of misinformation about the Covid-19 situation in Iran.

Since this reporting includes the prevalence of the virus, this is included in the government response, and therefore coded as 1.

*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 'Kenyan media reporting, meanwhile, has tended to repeat rather than question the government line. There have been few attempts to distill the reality behind the numbers announced at the daily briefings and probe the choices that the government has been making. While public officials have not made the media’s job easy, restricting the flow of information and the number of questions they are willing to answer during press briefings, it is also true that journalists have generally been reluctant to delve beyond official narratives. “Trust and obey” has seemed to be the overriding message.''

# Laos 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 The decree that regulates the emergency measures states that the government shall "strictly prohibit the advertisement of, release, forward any fake news via any media platform that can cause misunderstanding, panic and create negative impact on society. Task the agency for surveillance and response to the social complaints to closely monitor and strictly take action on those offenders." (Section 6). The decree also states that "the Task Force Committee shall provide detail guidance in a format of an easy understanding to disseminate through official media outlets" (Section 11).
This puts a strong de facto limitation on media reporting on the governments response to Covid-19 in Laos, by making it  punishable to report  on anything deemed to cause misunderstanding, panic and negative impact on the society, without any definition on what this constitutes.

# Mongolia

*Comments*:
 Mongolia amended the Law on Administrative Offenses to include a paragraph stating that: ”Misleading the public or disseminating false information in the event of a disaster, catastrophe, communicable disease, accident or danger shall be punishable by a fine of 500 togrogs for a person or 5,000 togrogs for a legal person unless criminally punishable” (Section 5.13.1).
As "false information" is poorly defined, and this law is being enacted and journalists and media outlets face the risk of being prosecuted for "disseminating false information", this is coded as 1, a de facto limitation on reporting on the governments response to Covid-19 is made as journalists and media outlets now that they can be fined on a vaguely formulated regulation on disinformation.

 Apart from the de jure measures mentioned in melim variable, I havent found other specific limitations on media reporting. 

''The decree enables the government to declare a ""state of health emergency"" and take exceptional measures to stop the spread of disease. Anyone who contravenes the decree that declares a health emergency, or incites others to contravene the decree through speech or threat uttered in a public place or meeting, written or printed materials, photos, posters, audiovisual or electronic communications, or any other means can be imprisoned one to three months or be fined 300 to 1,300 dirhams ($30-$130).''

In a statement on March 22, the Moroccan Ministry of Culture, Youth, and Sports, which oversees the country’s press, ordered all print newspapers to suspend their publication and distribution until further notice, and encouraged print outlets to use alternative methods to deliver the news. (the statement is found in the link in arabic)"

# Nicaragua 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 The government limits media reporting about covid-19 by not being transparent about the situation and not sharing the number of cases, deaths or tests. There are police officers by the hospitals to prevent journalists from filming or speaking with health professionals.  Burrials are happening during the night, so citizens won't know about them. Additionally, the government is blocking independent media from participating in press conferences.

# North Korea 
*Answer*: 0 

*Comments*:
 I did not find information on de-facto limitations on media reporting about the government response to the Covid-19 pandemic in North Korea. However, North Korea is notorious for its highly controlled media prior to the pandemic. North Koreans can be sent to concentration camps for viewing, reading or listening to content provided by media outlets outside the country. As the information coming into the country is also very strictly controlled, it would be difficult for North Koreans to compare responses and form an opinion on the North Korean government’s response towards the pandemic.

Otouna has not been seen on the air since 30 April, when he asked the minister about the lack of information about coronavirus victims, including those currently ill and those who have recovered, and about contradictions between the government’s figures and those given by the president on both the caseload and the lockdown’s economic and social consequences.''

# Rwanda 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 'Journalist and media worker arrested for violating curfew in Rwanda:
Police in Rwanda arrested journalist Dieudonné Niyonsenga and media worker Fidèle Komezusenge for violating the country’s COVID-19 lockdown. Both were on their way to report at the time. The Rwanda Investigation Bureau announced criminal charges on Twitter. Rwanda’s lockdown does not explicitly exempt journalists from moving freely to work.''

Also: ''At least four bloggers were arrested in Rwanda earlier this month for violating the government's directives, as they tried to cover coronavirus lockdown measures, according to Human Rights Watch.''

Also: ''TV director Hassan had notably finished a sensitive report investigating the impact of Rwanda’s lockdown measures on locals in poor districts. “These journalists were asking questions about why authorities were demolishing homes deemed unstable in working class areas without compensating their occupants,” Laurent Munyandilikirwa, head of Rwanda’s Observatory for human rights told RFI. The government argues the measure was to protect inhabitants from torrential rains, but Munyandilikirwa says their homes were never located in flood-prone areas to begin with. “They (the journalists) crossed the red line by seeking the truth,” believes the rights defender, who has urged the government to release any media professional detained for their Covid-19 coverage.''

However, while there hasn’t been measures on media freedom with regards to journalists and mainstream media, the Acting Inspector General (IGP) instructed the police to take legal action against those who publish posts on social media criticising government officials and obstructing their duties. The police have not indicated under what legal provision these actions will be taken. The police reportedly arrested more than seven individuals in the week after this order came into place. As of April 17 the police had reportedly arrested 17 individuals ‘for spreading false information’ about COVID-19. None of these people were journalists.
