*Comments*:
 'The UN Commission noted that some humanitarian organisations were refused access to sites where persons were quarantined in deplorable conditions. The quarantined persons should be provided with sufficient food, clean water and access to health facilities and medical services.''

''Human Rights Watch on Tuesday criticized the Burundian government’s performance in dealing with the coronavirus pandemic, accusing it of having a “denial and deflection approach to crisis management”.''
'' “On March 27, a hospital in Bujumbura, the country’s economic capital, alerted the government to three strongly suspected cases, who later reportedly tested negative. Several sources in the medical and humanitarian field have expressed concerns to Human Rights Watch that the authorities are not conducting enough tests to understand the extent to which the disease may be spreading,” said the statement.''

Also:
''In a statement, the Human Rights Watch said health authorities in the country blocked journalists from entering a COVID-19 press conference, indicating that the government is trying to suppress information about the pandemic.''

# Cambodia 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 1: Monoroom.info, a Khmer-language news website based in France, became inaccessible in Cambodia on 31 March after it published several articles about the coronavirus situation there, and has remained inaccessible ever since.

2: Sovann Rithy, the director of the TVFB news site, was arrested by the Phnom Penh municipal police yesterday evening on a charge of “incitement to cause chaos and harm social security” under article 495 of the criminal code, police chief Sar Theth said.

His crime was to have reported a comment about the economic effects of the Covid-19 crisis that the prime minister made during a press conference earlier in the day. As Sovann Rithy accurately reported in a Facebook post, Hun Sen said: “If motorbike-taxi drivers go bankrupt, sell your motorbikes for spending money. The government does not have the ability to help.”
 
The information ministry reacted by ordering the revocation of TVFB’s media licence on the grounds that its editor had “selected” the prime minister’s quote.

# Cameroon 
*Answer*: 2 

*Comments*:
 Cameroon’s Covid-19 reporting at the beginning of the pandemic was transparent; the minister of health published daily statistics on the number of infections, hospital admissions and casualties, but when the numbers grew substantially and Cameroon appeared as one of the top countries with covid19 cases in sub-saharan Africa, the government started revising its reporting strategy and access to information on the daily and actual number of new infections by switching to daily press briefings.

"It is now hard for journalists to get timely and detailed updates," said a reporter with a foreign broadcaster. "The updates now are mostly on recovery and hospitalised cases and deaths."

''Although there is no official limitation of access to Covid-19 related information, the government of Cameroon has however omitted from the public and mass media, vital information about the regional prevalence of Covid-19.''

''Media, civil society and opposition groups in Cameroon say the government there refused to provide official information about Covid-19 to media outlets and journalists perceived to be critical of it.''
''In Cameroon, the authorities are providing no information to several critical but very popular media outlets.''

 1: Journalists who have reported on the Corona virus and accused the government of understating the situation in Egypt have been asked to leave the country.

2: Currently, more than 500 websites—many of them connected to news outlets—are blocked inside the country.

6: In March, security forces arrested an Egyptian journalist for questioning official statistics in relation to the spread of COVID-19 on his personal Facebook page. He was held at an undisclosed location without any contact with the outside world for nearly a month before being brought in front of prosecutors to face accusations of “spreading false news” and “joining a terrorist organization”.

*Comments*:
 'Greece: Authorities deny access to health editors during briefings on COVID-19. As of March 23, the Greek Ministry of Health, citing public health safety reasons, has decided to close its doors to health editors on a daily basis from Sotiris Tsiodras' spokesman and Deputy Ministers of Civil Protection and Health. In addition, the journalists were informed that they will have the opportunity to ask one - and only one, although there are three speakers - a question per week, which should be submitted in writing to the Press Office, which will read it on "air", without it ability to clarify or apply pressure in order to respond effectively.''

# Guatemala 
*Answer*: 2 

*Comments*:
 There are several accusations that the government is interfering with the media coverage during the pandemic and Guatemalan journalists and human rights organizations published an open letter to complain about the situation. The president said: “I would like to put the media in quarantine but I cannot.” The government stopped holding press conferences, limited the official information that is shared with the media and closed the institutional chat group it had with journalists. The Human Rights Ombudsman stated that "in the face of the health emergency it is vital to maintain open, direct and continuous government communication with the press in order to guarantee the population their right to be informed" and recommended that the president and the ministry of health ensure that the press has free access to information regarding the pandemic.

# Hungary

# India 
*Answer*: 2 

*Comments*:
 The government has attempted to exercise total control over information about Covid-19. On 31 March 2020, it asked the supreme court to direct the media to publish nothing about the epidemic “without first ascertaining the facts from the mechanism provided by the government.” While the courts did not allow this, the made concessions by ruling that, to avoid the dissemination of “unverified news capable of causing panic,” the media must “refer to and publish the official version about the developments” including the government’s daily bulletin.

After this, the health ministry’s representatives told reporters that they would only take questions from Asian News International and the state TV broadcaster Doordarshan at the next days press conference. Both news outlets are well known for supporting Modi’s Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP).

# Indonesia 
*Answer*: 2 

*Comments*:
 The Indonesian Government, specifically the Health Ministry, has decided not to reveal important data on COVID-19 transmitted contacts, such as recently visited locations or travel history of the suspected people, claiming that it would most likely create a widespread panic among people and to keep the order. 

The Government has not been transparent in releasing data relating to the numbers of health workers infected by COVID-19, as well as hospitals where they are working. The only announcement by the Government was only made on March 14, 2020, when the spokesperson of the Government’s COVID-19 crisis team, Achmad Yurianto, stated that several medical practitioners had been infected by the virus and that some of them had passed away. 

The Secretary of the Indonesian Doctor Association Special Task Enforcement, Dyah Agustina, also stated that she did not know the precise number of medical workers who were suspected of COVID-19 infection or who had tested positive.

# Iraq 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 There are some reports on journalists being obstructed and denied access to information when trying to investigate the Covid-19 situation in Iraq. The Iraqi government also banned Reuters from Iraq for 3 months due to them reporting that the amount of infected people being much higher than the government had stated and that they had deliberately misreported the number of cases. This is coded as 1, since there is indeed obstructions to accessing Covid-19 related information, but there aren't as many such cases reported that it could be argued to be "widespread and ongoing".

# Italy 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 On journalists access to information, the IPI reports that the Italian Government " suspended all “non-urgent” requests for more than two months as part of its package of laws to tackle the pandemic". However, I have not found any additional information on this, and no other accusations of the emergency measures limiting access to information in general, or on Covid-19 related issues in specific. This is therefore coded as 1, that there seem to be occasional limitations to access to information (unclear in the IPI reporting whether they are covid-19 related), but that this does not seem systematic.

*Comments*:
 The decree that regulates the emergency measures states that the "the Task Force Committee shall provide detail guidance in a format of an easy understanding to disseminate through official media outlets" (Section 11).
In other words, only state sponsored media is allowed to report on the crisis, which de jure limits all access to information as only the government approved information is being disseminated to these media outlets.

 The Guardian reports that "The state of emergency has also imposed significant restrictions on who can speak to the media, with many doctors saying they were forbidden from discussing issues with the Guardian."
While this is indication of a serious limitation on access to information, this is also the only source found on this type of limitation (a lot of sources do quote this Guardian article however). Therefore, this is coded as 1 - there are strong accusations of limits on access to information, but only one report found of such limitations.

 President Duterte's emergency regulations are preventing independent media from covering official briefings on Covid-19 in the country. Only official media are allowed to attend the briefings.

''Rocil Otouna was discreetly sidelined as news anchor after putting some difficult questions about the coronavirus crisis to the justice minister in an interview two weeks ago. Otouna has not been seen on the air since 30 April, when he asked the minister about the lack of information about coronavirus victims, including those currently ill and those who have recovered, and about contradictions between the government’s figures and those given by the president on both the caseload and the lockdown’s economic and social consequences.''

However,

1: While there hasn’t been measures on media freedom with regards to journalists and mainstream media, the Acting Inspector General (IGP) instructed the police to take legal action against those who publish posts on social media criticising government officials and obstructing their duties. The police have not indicated under what legal provision these actions will be taken. The police reportedly arrested more than seven individuals in the week after this order came into place. As of April 17 the police had reportedly arrested 17 individuals ‘for spreading false information’ about COVID-19. None of these people were journalists.

2: Senior government figures have made public remarks associating the Muslim community with the Covid-19 infection.

# Syria 
*Answer*: 2 

*Comments*:
 Widespread reports mention that the syrian regime has sought to control and severely limit the amount of information about the virus in the country, the reporting, and the number of cases confirmed. Even with the increase of cases from Iran, which has a very close relationship with Syrians in the country as well as the regime, the Assad regime continued to deny any cases. ''It threatened hospitals and doctors that cited coronavirus cases. It deployed members of the secret police in hospitals across regime-held territories to control and oversee the narratives of coronavirus discussions and cases across hospitals."

# Thailand 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 1: Any information about the virus that the government deems to be “false or capable of causing fear in the public” is punishable by up to five years in prison. This may act as a form of deterrent towards Thai jounalists and media outlets thinking about reporting on the pandemic, it’s prevalence and the government’s approach to it.

2: Government representatives at a press conference on 25 March 2020 said that they would restrict the media to only reporting official information on COVID-19 and prosecute individuals whose statements are deemed critical of authorities’ COVID-19 response are of particular concern. At the press conference Prime Minister Prayut Chan-O-Cha stated that journalists would be prevented from interviewing officials and medical personnel and restricted to only covering information disseminated at official press conferences. Prime Minister Prayut Chan-O-Cha’s warning to “be careful about what they post on social media”, and threats of prosecutions for “abuse of social media” at a separate press conference on 24 March 2020 also fuel fears that authorities plan to disproportionately restrict online expression about COVID-19.

# Turkey 
*Answer*: 2 

*Comments*:
 Much of the arrests of journalists, and charges placed on them, have been based on journalists accessing information from hospitals or hospital staff on Covid-19 which the governmnt do not want them publishing and spreading. The Turkish government has more or less closed all access to information on Covid-19 according to Reporters withour Borders and Amnesty International, and  only wish the media to report on the information on Covid-19 released by the government itself.
Furthermore, there are numerous accusations that the Turkish government have delibirately underreported the number of Covid-19 cases in the country.
This is therefore coded as 2.

 Reporters without Borders report that: “Reporters are also facing restrictions in covering the government’s daily press briefings, during which the Prime Minister or another designated official provides updates to the public on the Covid-19 situation in the country. Journalists are limited to virtual participation, and their microphones are almost always cut immediately after an initial question, with follow-up questions rarely allowed - severely limiting their ability to rigorously question the presiding official.”
This is therefore coded as 1.

 Reporters without borders report on  a number of occurences, initially reported in varying media outlets in the U.S., where journalists have been denied access to information and public officials having been prohibited to talk to media from government officials.  
There consequently seem to be occasional cases of limiting access to Covid-19 related information, although this is not systematic.
