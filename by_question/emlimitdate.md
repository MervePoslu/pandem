 This is the initially declared end date. Within the legal instrument, there's a possibility to extend the period of Biosecurity Emergency indefinetly, but only for three months at a time. Already on 14th of May it was declared that the measures will be in place for another 3 months, thus ending on the 17th of September.

 In the initial anouncement, all measures taken within the Covid-19 Law was due to end at 13th of April. 
Note however that many have been extended, or parts of their content have been extended (more freedom of movement, but not full freedom for example). The Covid-19 Law has an end date in itself as well,  any measures taken within it can (and in some  cases have or will) end at 2020-12-31.

 NOTE: the cell does not allow for date values.
The first major measures taken were to limit social gatherings to 10 people as well as closing night clubs, bars etc. on the 18 of March, and these were initially set to the 30 of March. This is therefore the date coded here.
Note however that other measures have been taken with other time limits, and that the legal instrument under which these measures are taken has a sunset clause on 31 of March 2021.

 The state of emergency was declared on 2020-03-14 for 30 days (legislative decree n 593), extended on 2020-04-12 for 4 days (legislative decree 622), extended on 2020-04-16 for 15 days (legislative decree 631) and extended on 2020-04-30 for 15 days (legislative decree 634). Then, the president tried to extend it on 2020-05-16 for 30 days via executive decree 18, but the decree was considered inconstitutional by the supreme court and suspended on 2020-05-18, because it did not have legislative approval. The president insisted on declaring a new state of emergency and after a few days of debate between the executive and the legislative, the legislative decree 648 from 2020-05-30 declared state of emergency for another 15 days and defined guidelines for reopening the country.

*Comments*:
 The Imposition of Restrictions Act (2020) allows for restrictions to be declared "for a period of not more than three months" but also allows the president to extend these restrictions for "not more than one month at a time but in any event for not more than three months" (Article 4). The president initially imposed restrictions on movement, gatherings, and travel for two to three weeks. He has invoked the right and extended the provisions on several occasions, most recently 15 June 2020. Presently, according to E.I. 64 of 15 March, the main emergency provisions under the restrictions act are set to expire on 31 July.

 Maximum amount of days the government is allowed to declare a state of emergency before they need to renew it is 7 days, and the initial state of emergency was thus limited to March 26.

# Lesotho 
*Answer*: 2020-05-05 

*Comments*:
 The Constitution of Lesotho limits a state of emergency to 14 days, unless authorized by the legislature, which may allow for a period of no more than six-months. The legislature refused to approve a measure that would have extended the state of emergency beyond the initial 14 day period allowed for in the constitution. At that time, it had been suspended by the prime minister. Later the constitutional court ruled the suspension of parliament unconstitutional. It has since been reinstated and the prime minister resigned.

 "The President of the 
Republic, Dr. George Manneh Weah has said that the state of emergency which is due to expire on June 9, 2020 will not be renewed."

"The Ministry of Justice has clarified that the June 9 date contained in the Executive Mansion press release as the stipulated date ending the state of emergency was an error. ... the effective date of the commencement of the 60-day state of emergency was April 21, therefore, the official expiration would be June 21, contrary to the June 9 mentioned in the Executive Mansion press release."

 Turkey has used a varied set of existing legal instruments to implement emergency response (e.g.  The Law on the Protection of Public Health (Law no.1593) and the Law on Provincial Administration (Law no.5442)), and there is therefore no single legal instrument to highlight here.
