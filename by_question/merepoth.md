# Burma/Myanmar 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 Myanmar has used Article 505 of the Penal code, which states that spreading information that ”cause fear or alarm to the public” is punishable with up to two years in prison, to arrest and jail a journalist reporting on Covid-19, as well as having closed down over 200 websites by claiming that they have spread ”fake news”. As the regulation in use allows for any arbitrary interpretation of ”fear or alarm to the public”, and media outlets online are being closed down, this is deemed a de facto limitation on reporting on non-Covid-19 related news as well.

# China 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 The Chinese government has maintained a very tight and highly controlled media since before the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. Reporters without Borders have reported how China’s state owned media is currently under the close control of the Community Party. While there are foreign journalists and news agencies working in China, the encounter multiple obstacles while working in the field. More than 100 journalists are currently detained in conditions that pose a threat to their lives. In this way de-facto limitations are already in place on media reporting.

*Comments*:
 18 amendments were made to the emergency law. However, only five were clearly linked to public health developments. Examples of the amendments that are not directly linked to the public health developments:

1: Allows the president even in the absence of any public health purpose, to restrict “public gatherings, protests, rallies, festivities, and any other form of gathering, including private gatherings.”

2: Allows the president to restrict anyone from owning, transporting, selling, purchasing, or exporting any goods or services. The amendments also allow him to control prices of goods and services and to “determine methods of collecting monetary and in-kind donations … and rules of their dispensing and spending.”

# India 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 1: The government has attempted to exercise total control over information about Covid-19. On 31 March 2020, it asked the supreme court to direct the media to publish nothing about the epidemic “without first ascertaining the facts from the mechanism provided by the government.” While the courts did not allow this, the made concessions by ruling that, to avoid the dissemination of “unverified news capable of causing panic,” the media must “refer to and publish the official version about the developments” including the government’s daily bulletin.

2: In May 2020, police registered cases against six journalists in the northern Himachal Pradesh state for reporting about problems faced by migrant workers amid the COVID-19 lockdown. Some reports stated that the stranded laborers did not receive adequate help from the authorities. Police said the reports were "fake" and invoked the Disaster Management Act against the journalists.

3: In the southern Tamil Nadu state, Andrew Sam Raja Pandian, a digital journalist and founder of the SimpliCity news portal, was arrested on April 18 for publishing two news articles related to COVID-19. Pandian and his colleague, Jerald Aruldas, were held by police for reporting about the alleged government corruption amid the pandemic and how doctors faced food shortages while working during the lockdown.

# Indonesia 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 Journalists who criticize the government face the possibility of up to 18 months in prison under a directive that the head of Criminal Investigation Agency issued on 4 April 2020. The directive orders the police to crack down on ‘corona virus related hoaxes’, ‘online frauds regarding the sales of health equipment’ and ‘hostile information about the president and government’.

Daniel Bastard, head of RSF’s Asia-Pacific desk has said that ‘In this directive, the Indonesia police are taking advantage of the need to combat disinformation linked to the Covid-19 pandemic in order to rein in journalists who might want to publish information critical of President Joko Widodo or his government

# Iran 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 Through Irans ban on printed media, they have halted the reporting on non-covid-19 related news as well with reference to Covid-19. While the news outlets are allowed to publish online, it is still a de facto infringement of media reporting on non-covid-19 related news, and this is therefore coded as 1.

# Laos 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 The decree that regulates the emergency measures states that the government shall "strictly prohibit the advertisement of, release, forward any fake news via any media platform that can cause misunderstanding, panic and create negative impact on society. Task the agency for surveillance and response to the social complaints to closely monitor and strictly take action on those offenders." (Section 6). The decree also states that "the Task Force Committee shall provide detail guidance in a format of an easy understanding to disseminate through official media outlets" (Section 11).
This puts a strong de facto limitation on media reporting on non-Covid-19 related news in Laos, by making it  punishable to report on anything deemed to cause misunderstanding, panic and negative impact on the society, without any definition on what this constitutes.

# Malaysia 
*Answer*: 0 

*Comments*:
 The Malaysian authorities have arrested journalists under Section 505 of the penal code, which bans statements causing "fear or alarm to the public". While this vague formulation could be used to prosecute journalists on non-Covid-19 related news as well, there is no reports found of that happening, and the authorities seem to only use this legislation to place de facto limitations on reporting on Covid-19 related issues as of yet. This is therefore coded as 0.

 Apart from the de jure measures mentioned in melim variable, I havent found other specific limitations on media reporting. 

''The decree enables the government to declare a ""state of health emergency"" and take exceptional measures to stop the spread of disease. Anyone who contravenes the decree that declares a health emergency, or incites others to contravene the decree through speech or threat uttered in a public place or meeting, written or printed materials, photos, posters, audiovisual or electronic communications, or any other means can be imprisoned one to three months or be fined 300 to 1,300 dirhams ($30-$130).''

In a statement on March 22, the Moroccan Ministry of Culture, Youth, and Sports, which oversees the country’s press, ordered all print newspapers to suspend their publication and distribution until further notice, and encouraged print outlets to use alternative methods to deliver the news. (the statement is found in the link in arabic)"

# Philippines 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 Philippines’ biggest broadcaster ABS-CBN was forced off air on 5 May 2020. The network had expected to continue broadcasting during the coronavirus lockdown. However the National Telecommunications Commission decided against renewing its 25 year franchise. Duterte has repeatedly threatened to stop ABS-CBN, and previously accused it of failing to broadcast his campaign advertisements. In a speech in December, he taunted the network, stating: “ABS-CBN, your contract is about to expire. If I were you, you’re better off selling it … I will make sure that you will remember this episode of our times for ever.”

 Wojciech Jakub Atys, a photographer for Gazeta Wyborcza, was asked to appear in court after taking pictures (alledgedly because of breaking social distancing rules) of a protest outside Jarosław Kaczynski’s home on 29 March that opposed changes to the electoral law. Another reporter for OKO.press website potentially faces a 13,000 fine for planning to cover a protest on 10 April outside Jarosław Kaczynski’s and "failure to respect social distancing and organising a public gathering." (the protest was planned but did not take place).

# Rwanda 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 'TV director Hassan had notably finished a sensitive report investigating the impact of Rwanda’s lockdown measures on locals in poor districts. “These journalists were asking questions about why authorities were demolishing homes deemed unstable in working class areas without compensating their occupants,” Laurent Munyandilikirwa, head of Rwanda’s Observatory for human rights told RFI. The government argues the measure was to protect inhabitants from torrential rains, but Munyandilikirwa says their homes were never located in flood-prone areas to begin with. “They (the journalists) crossed the red line by seeking the truth,” believes the rights defender, who has urged the government to release any media professional detained for their Covid-19 coverage.''

# Saudi Arabia 
*Answer*: 0 

*Comments*:
 There are no indications that de facto limitations on media reporting about Covid-19 has been imposed beyond the already existing strong limitations on the media in Saudi Arabia. Consequently, the emergency measures has not enacted any further de facto limitations on media reporting about non-Covid-19 related news.

# Thailand 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 1: On May 22, Bangkok police arrested prominent pro-democracy activists Anurak Jeantawanich and Tosaporn Serirak for violating the ban on public assembly – one of the emergency measures imposed to slow the spread of Covid-19. The arrest was triggered by a remembrance service they held earlier that day with supporters of the United Front for Democracy against Dictatorship – known as the “Red Shirts” – to mark the 6th anniversary of the 2014 military coup. 

2: Thai authorities previously arrested Anurak on the same charges on May 13, when he held a remembrance service to demand justice for those killed and wounded by the military during the crackdown on the 2010 Red Shirts protests. Even though thermal scanners to detect fevers were provided at the events and participants wore face masks, the activists were accused of ignoring social distancing, acting in a way likely to spread the virus, and disobeying lawful orders in both cases. If found guilty, they face two years in prison and a 40,000 baht (US$1,250) fine.

3: In southern Thailand, local authorities in Songkhla province denied a request by villagers in Singha Nakhon district to hold a rally on May 24 in protest of the government’s plan to build beach walls and breakwaters on Muang Ngam Beach. Despite an assurance from the organizers to follow social distancing and other Covid-19 measures to keep people safe, officials prohibited the rally.

# Turkey

*Comments*:
 While there are de facto limitations as a consequence of or in relation to the pandemic, and continuing reports on journalists being charged with criminal offences for investigative reporting, no case has been found where the Turkish government or its agents have justified such acts of charging journalists for reporting on non-Covid-19 related news with any reference to the pandemic. Therefore, this is coded as 0.
