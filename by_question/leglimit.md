# Algeria 
*Answer*: 3 

*Comments*:
 In March, the U.S. Library of Congress reported that the Chairman of the National Assembly had postponed all sessions and activities as a preventive measure against Covid-19. But on 22 April 2020, Aljazeera reported that the National Assembly passed a new law to criminalize fake news in a fairly empty sitting due to social distancing measures. In addition, the IDEA data on legislatures says that the Algerian National Assembly has normal procedure in April. However, the legislature is still not entirely suspended, given that any laws passed while the legislature was temporarily suspended must be retroactively agreed to, but severe restrictions on who can attend and take the floor in the legislature.

# Australia

 When a Biosecurity Emergency is in place, the  ”Biosecurity Act provides that emergency requirements determined by the Health Minister under subsection 477(1) are not subject to disallowance by the Parliament." (quote from https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Scrutiny_of_Delegated_Legislation/Scrutiny_of_COVID-19_instruments).
However, these powers given to the Health Minister are fairly narrow and focused on health-related measures. This is therefore coded as 2 - the Health Minister has the right to rule by decree on narrowly Covid-19 related issues.

*Comments*:
 The National Assembly of Cameroon held its first session of 2020 from 20 March to 18 April and resumed sittings for its second session on 10 June. Decisions regarding the emergency response to Covid-19 have come primarily through the Prime Minister's office or public health authorities, without requiring approval from the parliament. Such measures include requiring masks and closing borders, curfews, social distancing measures and limits on public gatherings. Some of these have been eased since 30 April.

# Central African Republic 
*Answer*: 2 

*Comments*:
 While the Constitution authorizes the president to declare a state of emergency, requiring that the National Assembly enact public health emergency laws, the president has thus far avoided this and the government has enacted social distancing measures and other restrictions through a series of gradual announcements without reference to a specific legal instrument. The legislature continues to convene but with social distancing guidelines. On 20 May, it questioned the government's response to the pandemic, citing poor performance despite its emergency measures. In addition, the Constitutional Court ruled on 05 June that it would be unconstitutional for the president and parliamentary terms to be extended due to the pandemic. Elections scheduled for December 2020 and May 2020, respectively should continue as planned.

''On 5 June 2020, the Constitutional Court of the Central African Republic (CAR) rejected as unconstitutional a proposed constitutional amendment that would have allowed the extension of the duration of presidential and parliamentary terms in the case of ‘force majeure’. The proposed amendment emerged in a context of the disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic causing concerns over the timely organisation of presidential and legislative elections in December 2020 and March 2021, respectively.''

# Chad 
*Answer*: 2 

*Comments*:
 It is not very clear. The president may take measures by ordinance during the emergency situation, and the National Assembly cannot be dissolved, but Chad has been postponing its parliamentary elections since 2015, and are now delayed again because of the coronavirus for 2021.

''at the National Assembly, "the offices of the members of the bureau, the commissions and the general secretariat must reduce the presence of staff in the offices to the necessary". But "the work in committee continues with the strict observation of barrier gestures and the systematic disinfection of meeting rooms", ensures the Monitoring Committee.''

Article 97
The measures taken by virtue of the preceding Article must be motivated by the will
to assure constitutional public powers, within the least time period, the means to
accomplish their mission.
Also, Article 96 • When the Institutions of the Republic, the independence of the Nation, the territorial integrity or the fulfilment of international commitments are threatened in a serious and immediate manner, such that the regular functioning of the public powers is interrupted, the President of the Republic, after obligatory consultation of the President of the National Assembly and with the President of the Supreme Court, takes in the Council of Ministers, for a time period not exceeding thirty (30) days, the exceptional measures required by the circumstances. This period may only be extended after the conforming opinion of the National
Assembly. The National Assembly meets of plain right if it is not in session.

Article 97 constitution: The National Assembly may not be dissolved during the exercise of exceptional powers.

# Democratic Republic of the Congo 
*Answer*: 4 

*Comments*:
 The Senate and National Assembly of the DRC decided on March 18 to suspend all sessions for the month of March due to COVID-19 (until April 5).
The regular session opened on 16 March, but all legislative activities were suspended from 18 March to 05 April due to Covid-19. Since then, the legislature has resumed with special rules of procedure for social distancing. While the legislature must approve the state of emergency, this gives powers to the executive to rule by decree "the measures necessary to respond to the situation" using ordinances deliberated through the Council of Ministers. The Prime Minister and the National Assembly, however, may challenge the government and consider motions of no confidence or censorship.

 The legal instrument, the amenmdent, does not affect the parliaments lawmaking role. It does provide the Health Minister some extraordinary power, but these powers are defined and demarcated in the amendment that parliament passed, and does not provide measures that could impact the lawmaking role of the parliament as such.

# Iran 
*Answer*: 0 

*Comments*:
 The Iranian Parliament's law making role has not been affected by the emergency measures taken by Iran, according to the IPU. Parlamentarians have primarily worked remotely, but they have for example worked with the government to pass financial aid packages during the pandemic. And no other indications have been found that the Iranian parliament has been restricted in its power or law making role during the pandemic (beyond the already existing restrictions where several formal and informal powers can monitor and veto the parliament’s actions, but this is not related to Covid-19 or the emergency measures). This is therefore coded as 0.

It is normal in this period that there would be few sittings. Both Houses met to pass emergency legislation in late March.".
Most work is done remotely, and parts of the regular programme have been cancelled so that parliament only works on Covid-19 related issues, but they have convened when necessary and they have passed the bills enabling the emergency response, and no indication is given that this response in turn has limited the parliaments lawmaking role or power in any way. This is therefore coded as 0.

# Israel 
*Answer*: 0 

*Comments*:
 The new parliament was sworn in on 16 March, and some committees and regular work was not fully up and running at the end of march, and only a certain amount of MPs were initially allowed in the Plenary at the same time due to health reasons, the Knesset did not work according to a regular programme, but rather focused its work on the Covid-19 pandemic. It is once again convening fully, however, and there's no indication that the parliaments lawmaking role was limited before or during this due to the emergency measures (the parliament was temporarly closed for four days due to the speaker refusing to obey the regulations and initiate elections for a new speaker, but his actions were overruled by the court, a new speaker was chosen and parliamentary work resumed - this four day hiatus is not linked to any emergency measures, but was an act of the previous speaker himself that caused it).
The IPU summarizes that: "The plenary and temporary committees have been established and are meeting as usual. Standing committees will be formed upon formation of a government. The Supreme Court has ruled that a parliamentary committee must be set up to oversee emergency powers given to the Israeli Security Agency that allow it to use surveillance technology to track the movements of people with COVID-19."
This is therefore coded as 0, as the Knesset is operating as usual and overseeing the governments work with the pandemic, and that there are no indications that this or other work has been limited by the emergency measures.

# Italy 
*Answer*: 0 

*Comments*:
 The Italian parliament has continued its work throughout the pandemic, although with several changes to the regular programmes and much work being done remotely or in the plenary/committees consisting of smaller groups. 
The Italian government has since the state of emergency declaration issued a number of emergency measures through decree laws, which in the Italian legal system is an instrument that allows the Government to enact measures that become effective immediately, but which must be voted on by the Parliament within 60 days or the decree is terminated. Consequently, while the government has the power to present decrees which are implemented before the parliament votes on it, the parliament can terminate it as soon as it convenes to vote on the decree (Article 77, Italian Constitution). Since the Italian Parliament have continued its work throughout the pandemic (and so far approved all decree laws), this is regarded as not having affected their law making role. Furthermore, there's no indication that any of the emergency measures themselves have in any way affected the law making role of the parliament. This is therefore coded as 0.

# Ivory Coast 
*Answer*: 2 

*Comments*:
 The President can rule by decree on covid19 related issues. 
Also: ''The Ivorian Constitution provides, ''when the institutions of the Republic, the independence of the Nation, the integrity of its territory or the execution of it international commitments are under grave and immediate threat, and that the regular operation of the constitutional public authorities is interrupted, the President of the Republic shall take the measures required by the circumstances, after officially consulting with the Prime Minister, the Presidents of [the National Assembly and the Senate], as well as the Constitutional Council. The same article of the Constitution specifies that the President may not dissolve the National Assembly during such times, and that the Parliament always has the right to meet. There does not appear to be any formal provision in Ivorian law regarding the functioning of the national legislature under emergency measures, nor does Ivorian law appear to provide for any sort of “emergency parliament” with devolved powers from the whole parliament to address crisis situations.''

''Due to the current COVID-19 pandemic, the National Assembly has limited all meetings to a maximum of 50 participants. Furthermore, the President of the National Assembly has requested that all members, staff, and visitors wash their hands or use the hand sanitizer available at washing stations installed at the building’s entrances and exits.''

 The government declared a state of emergency that was ratified by the legislature on 24 March and extended on 14 April. The Constitution (Chapter 74, Article 5, point 1) says that the legislature has authority to ratify or repeal presidential decrees on emergency measures (“The Jogorku Kenesh shall introduce the state of emergency in cases and in accordance with procedure envisaged in the constitutional law, shall approve or repeal Presidential decrees on this matter”). The legislature ratified and, in some cases, recommended the government to make changes on emergency measures. There were also Q&A sessions where the government reported on the implementation of the emergency measures to the legislature.

# Lebanon 
*Answer*: 2 

*Comments*:
 The parliamentary Union, Reuters and two local media outlets (The New Arab and Arab News) report that the Lebanese parliament meetings were postponed March 10 for health reasons. Since then, they have convened a couple of times, the first being at April 21, and they have during these sessions performed a lot of the regular parliamentary work. However, as the parliament has only held sparse sessions, the government has been given enhanced control during this time. This is therefore coded as 2, as the government has gained an increased capacity to rule by decree during the crisis and due to parliament not having regular sessions, but that parliament still convene and perform their work at times during the crisis means that it is neither suspended nor has let the government fully rule by decree.

# Lesotho 
*Answer*: 3 

*Comments*:
 The Prime Minister prorogued (suspended) the legislature for three months on 20 March 2020. However, on 20 April 2020, the Constitutional Court rejected this decision and ordered the legislature to reopen. Subsequently, the embattled Prime Minister resigned. In addition, the Parliament has continued to work despite the suspension (2)

''Lesotho’s Prime Minister, Thomas Thabane, on Friday 20 March 2020 issued a legal notice proclaiming that he had prorogued parliament.''

''Legal Notice 21 of 2020 contained a decision by the Prime Minister in terms of s 91(3) of the Constitution to prorogue Parliament from 20 March to 19 June 2020. The decision of the Prime Minister to prorogue Parliament was based on s 83 read together with s 91 of the Constitution. The decision was challenged and set aside in All Basotho Convention v The Prime Minister on the basis that it was irrational.''

# Madagascar 
*Answer*: 2 

*Comments*:
 The President can rule by decree in emergency situations. However, it is not very clear whether this applies strictly to issues related with the respective emergency.

Article 61, Constitution: ''...The proclamation of the situation of exception confers on the President of the Republic special powers of which the extent and the duration are established by an organic law.
From the proclamation of one of the situations of exception aforesaid, the President of the Republic can legislate by way of ordinance on the matters that arise within the domain of the law.

Art. 4, law 91-011, 1991- The proclamation of an exceptional situation confers on the President of the Republic of the special powers necessary by the circumstances for which it was proclaimed and puts at his disposal all the civil and military means likely to be implemented for this effect.

# Morocco 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 'Based on Article 81 of the Moroccan Constitution, in extraordinary cases of necessity and emergency, the government can adopt decrees having the force of law, which are immediately binding on adoption, but require parliamentary approbation. On March 23, 2020, the parliament adopted the bills 2.20.292 / 2.20.293 establishing the state of health emergency on the national territory and empowering the government, to take all measures aimed at the containment of COVID-19.''

Also, some social distancing measures were taken: ''To limit the risk of infection and observe social distancing while keeping Parliament functioning, the secretaries general of both houses reduced the staff on site to a core group carrying out essential duties, while others are teleworking. A communication and follow-up cell was set up to raise staff awareness of hygiene measures to put in place in parliament.''

 Section 2(1) of the Act enables the Government of Nepal to take ‘necessary action’ and ‘issue necessary orders applicable to the general public or a group of any persons’ to ‘root out or prevent’ the development or spread of an infectious disease.

The Act is rather broad. Section 2(1) can, in theory, provide legal foundation for any government action taken to tackle COVID-19—both moderate and extraordinary.

 According to Article 126 of the Constitution, the government can rule by decree: "During a state of war or emergency, the Government, in accordance with the Constitution and law, issues decrees with the force of law. The authorization of the Government to issue decrees with the force of law lasts until the termination of the state of war or emergency, on which the Assembly decides."  The parliament has been dissolved since February 2020 due to general elections initially scheduled for 12 April 2020 (i.e. not covid-19) and thus coded as 0. Based on the parliament's website, it held no meetings since the end of February.

# Norway 
*Answer*: 0 

*Comments*:
 The IPU Reports that: "The Norwegian Parliament (the Storting) introduced a number of measures which will be in place until end of April. These measures include: the number of MPs at plenary meetings and during voting is reduced to 87 from 102; plenary will take decisions only on urgent issues identified by the presidency following consultations with leaders of party groups in Parliament; some rules of procedure are temporarily suspended (deadlines, physical presence in Committee meetings with priority given to tele/video conferencing); reduced committee workload (priority given to urgent cases and bills); cancellation of international and domestic committee members travel. The Storting also established a coronavirus special committee. On 21 March, Parliament adopted the Enabling Act authorizing Government to make decisions which, according to the Constitution, must be taken in Parliament. The aim is to enable Government to take measures to limit the disruption of the normal functioning of society and mitigate the negative consequences of the pandemic for the population and on the economy. The Act is valid for a month but can also be repealed by the Storting at any given time."
Consequently, the law making role of the parliament is somewhat decreased as the government is given the right to make decisions that parliament usually needs to approve. However, as the parliament also passed an amendment on this stating that " If at least one-third of the total number of Members does not support a regulation or parts of a regulation, the MPs in question may send a written declaration to the Storting’s Presidium. As soon as the Presidium receives such a declaration, it will notify the Government. The Corona Act obligates the King to revoke the regulations in question with immediate effect." (https://www.stortinget.no/en/In-English/About-the-Storting/News-archive/Front-page-news/2019-2020/the-corona-act/)
Therefore, the parliament is still involved in urgent law making during the presence of the Corona Act, and only a third of the MPs is needed to revoke any regulation. Considering this, the law making role is regarded to not have been affected, since it both involved in some urgency law making and can revoke them.

 Did not find any information on the lawmaking role of the legislature being limited due to the emergency measures. 

1: The military was impatient with the prime minister’s initial reluctance to impose national lockdown, and deployed troops to enforce provincial-level restrictions.

2: The National Assembly of Pakistan was prorogued from 15 May to 05 June 2020 by the president, without direct reference to Covid-19. It has since resumed sittings. Initially some lockdown measures were adopted at the local level, to the dismay of the Prime Minister. According to a report by Brookings - "the government has since given in to a strange mix of pandemic denialism and exceptionalism".

# Papua New Guinea 
*Answer*: 2 

*Comments*:
 During a state of emergency, the constitution in part allows for emergency laws (passed by parliament) and emergency regulation (decrees by the head of state). The parliament has approved three such emergency laws, and these constitute the legislation that outlines the overall emergency response. The capacity for the head of state to invoke temporary legislation, the emergency regulation, however does limit parliaments law making role to some extent. However, they are also restricted in time (expire after 28 days), can be revoked by parliament and may only be issued of the parliament cannot reasonably convene in time for passing such a regulation as an emergency law. This is therefore coded as 2.

 Law n. 836/Article 13: "In cases of epidemics or catastrophes, the Executive Power is empowered to declare in a state of sanitary emergency the whole or affected part of the national territory, determining its character and establishing the appropriate measures, being able to demand extraordinary specific actions from public and private institutions, as well as the general population". Decree n. 3456/art. 5: "Encourage the Legislative and Judicial Powers to take the necessary measures for the accompaniment and collaboration in the management of the measures prepared for the prevention and mitigation of the expansion of the Coronavirus (COVID-19)".
The entire parliament was in quarantine after one senator was diagnosed with covid-19. Then, the Paraguayan Parliament modified its rules to allow sessions to be held remotely.

 The executive has the autonomy to rule by decree on covid-19 related issues. There was no parliament in place when the state of emergency was declared, since the president dissolved the congressed in 2019 and called for new elections. The new congress was installed after the state of emergency was declared and is working remotely.

# Rwanda 
*Answer*: 2 

*Comments*:
 The government has made several proclamations limiting movement, enforcing social distancing rules, and curfews, and at one stage lockdown, since mid-March. These have originated from the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Local Government, and the Office of the Prime Minister, who has increasingly handled the government emergency response through the Cabinet. All of these decrees have originated from the executive, without direct vote from the legislature. The legislature continues to meet, but less regularly and with social distancing measures.

The lockdown on March 21 indeed affected the parliamentary meetings , which were held online, and the first time the Parliament convened since the partial lift of the Lockdown was on an extraordinary session on May 13 ''to allow to vote on and allow the Government to take loans meant to hasten the distribution of electricity''.

# Serbia 
*Answer*: 3 

*Comments*:
 Based on Article 200 of the Constitution, "During the state of emergency, the National Assembly shall convene without any special call for assembly and it may not be dismissed."Although the parliament should approve the emergency measures, it didn't meet from the declaration of the state of emergency until 28 April 2020 and thus approved the measures, including the declaration of the state of emergency, retroactively, which significantly limited its de-facto lawmaking power.

# Sweden 
*Answer*: 0 

*Comments*:
 The emergency measures does not affect the law making role of the parliament, and parliament still needs to approve measures taken by the government under the amendment.  The government can only enact regulations itself based on the amendment if it is of such urgency that it can't wait for parliamentary approval, and the parliament needs to be presented any such regulations as soon as possible and approve or deny it. Furthermore, any law making role outside of this amendment has not been affected by the emergency measures, and the parliament continues its work more or less as usual (but with some changes in terms of working remotely and only voting with a fewer set of MPs).

# Switzerland 
*Answer*: 2 

*Comments*:
 The emergency situation allows the Federal Council to enact ordinances to mitigate the emergency that the parliament does not need to approve (but which will expire after 6 months if it does not approve it), through the emergency situation as it is regulated in the constitution (Article 185) and the Epidemics Act. The ordinance that is the main legal instrument to handle the pandemic is one such ordinance. Consequently, the constitution and Empidemics Act gives the government a right to narrowly rule by decree (measures must be related to the emergency, and they expire if parliament don't approve them). This is therefore coded as 2.

 The Syrian parliament suspended its sessions on March 22 as a preventive measure against the spread of Covid-19. Also, the parliamentaty elections got suspended. But this is the only relevant information I could find. 
However, the President and Party have rights to issue decrees superseding the legislature's power under ''normal times'', so it seems like the increased powers the executive has gained due to covid are not any different.

# Togo 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 On March 30, 2020, the Togolese National Assembly passed Law No. 2020-005 (2), empowering the Government to take measures under the law by Ordinance. Thus, all the consequent measures taken, including the declaration of the state of emergency, had already been authorized by the National Assembly, and in addition as article 5 of the Law No. 2020-005 mentions, ''During the empowerment period, the Government shall communicate to the National Assembly, at its request, any measure taken or implemented in application of this law.''
 The Law No. 2020-005 clearly lists all the domains and the specific policy areas that the Government may decide on.
Also: Art. 94 of the Constitution: ''The National Assembly may not be dissolved during the duration of the state of siege or the state of urgency''.

# Tunisia 
*Answer*: 3 

*Comments*:
 The constitution is vague. Article 70: "...for a limited period not exceeding two months, and for a specific purpose, the Head of Government [can] issue decree-laws of a legislative character, to be submitted for ratification to the Assembly immediately after the end of the period of authorization." 
Article 80:"In the event of imminent danger threatening the nation’s institutions or the security or independence of the country, and hampering the normal functioning of the state, the President of the Republic may take any measures necessitated by the exceptional circumstances, after consultation..."

# Turkey 
*Answer*: 3 

*Comments*:
 The Turkish Parliament suspended sessions for six weeks from 16 April to 31 May 2020, with direct reference to Covid-19. Media reported on 26 June that parliament had again shut until 30 June due to the virus. The Turkish constitution allows for the declaration of a state of emergency (as does the Law on the State of Emergency [Law no. 2935]), but such action requires that all emergency presidential decrees be sent to Parliament the same day, debated and resolved within three months otherwise they are considered repealed. Turkey has not adopted a state of emergency, rather the executive has issued decrees with reference to ordinary laws -- Law on the Protection of Public Health (Law no. 1593) and the Law on Provincial Administration (Law no. 5442) -- thereby avoiding legislative approval. A prior Constitutional Court judgement in 2016 allows for vague adoption of measures related to emergencies.

 Parliamentary 
committees have moved to 100 per cent remote working. Nothing seems to suggest that they are limited in their work by other means, or that the exectutive has any extra power as a result of the emergency measures.

*Comments*:
 For health reasons, parliament worked remotely from 26 March to 21 April, but have resumed work although with limited number of MPs present at each time. Committees are also working, and the parliament have both amended and passed laws. The emergency measures has thus not affected the parliaments law making role, and this is coded as 0.

# United States of America 
*Answer*: 0 

*Comments*:
 The National Emergency Act, or related emergency measures taken such as under the Stafford Act and Public Health Service Act, do not provide the executive any additional lawmaking power, nor does it limit the legislatures lawmaking role. The National Emergency Act grants the executive access to a number of emergency authority statutes that can be activated.  Consequently, only already existing statues are made available, not the capacity to without the legislature create new ones.

# Zambia 
*Answer*: 4 

*Comments*:
 Emergency measures have been rolled out under the Public Health Act, thus do not allow for executive decree. However, the Zambia parliament adjourned sine die in reference to the Covid-19 pandemic on 18 March 2020, preventing it to conduct its lawmaking role for nearly two months before it resumed sittings on 09 June 2020.

 According to the Civil Protection Notice, "In pursuance of the object of these regulations the Minister may (in consultation with the President, and in conformity with any directions the President may give) by orders published in the Gazette ... impose restrictions" on several areas to hinder the spread of covid-19. The legislature has adjourned a week earlier (18 March) than scheduled due to Covid-19, and after reconvening on 05 May, adjourned again until 19 May.
