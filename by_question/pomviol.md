# Algeria 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 Although the police incidents have been targeted against political opponents during the demonstrations that took place, it is still within the enforcement of the covid19 measures because the government had banned public gatherings.

''When thousands of Algerians went out to demonstrate on March 7, the government response was overly severe. Security forces mobilized in large numbers to stop the demonstration, and police forces chased protesters and used clubs to beat them back. No distinction was made between men and women, young and old. Several activists, journalists, and students were arrested and accused of undermining national unity, including the famous journalist Khaled Drareni who was filming the protest live. Imene Meddour, a thirty-year-old mother, was arrested for posting a video that denounced the alleged corruption of officials managing a quarantine site in the city of Oran. Her baby was taken away while she was in confinement on April 2. Many perceived this action as excessive oppression, and her case went viral on social media.''

*Comments*:
 There are reports of some instances of physical harassment against Rohingyans by both police and military who guard checkpoints in place due to emergency measures. However, no sources found have stated any more severe cases of violence, or that this physical harassment is widespread. This is therefore coded as 1.
Note here that the substantial violence by the military in the Rakhine state is not part of the emergency measures, and no sources have mentioned that the state or military have excused or legitimized that violence with any reference to Covid-19.

# Cameroon

*Comments*:
 'Police in Cameroon have detained several hundred people for not wearing face masks in public…''
''state security agents have been accused of using violence violence in some instances to enforce this measure or have extorted money from those caught in breach of the rule.''

''A politicized national response to the Covid-19 pandemic has led to the arrest, detention and violation of rights of some aid workers, and members of opposition parties.''

''Several volunteers from the "Survie-Cameroon-Survival Initiative" project have been arrested in recent days, according to officials of the initiative, which is sponsored by Maurice Kamto.''

''On May 11, 6 volunteers from the “Survival Initiative,” a fundraising initiative launched by opposition leader Maurice Kamto to respond to the health emergency, were arrested while handing out protective masks and sanitizing gel for free to people in Yaoundé, the capital. The arrests would be laughable if they weren’t so serious. The volunteers face charges of rebellion and remain in detention. If found guilty, they could face up to 4 years in prison.''

# Democratic Republic of the Congo 
*Answer*: 2 

*Comments*:
 'Days after Congo announced emergency restrictions to curb the new coronavirus, a police video started circulating online showing an officer in the capital beating a taxi driver for violating a one-passenger limit.''

''State security forces, in responding to lawbreaking and violence, should respect human rights including only using force when strictly necessary. On March 29, Gen. Sylvano Kasongo, the head of police in Kinshasa, appeared to be ordering police officers to beat a motorcycle-taxi driver, in apparent “punishment” for violating social distancing measures, video footage indicated.''

''On March 30, the police killed at least 3 people and wounded 11 others, according to a UN source, when they fired live rounds at members of the Bundu dia Kongo politico-religious movement who were demonstrating in Kinshasa to “chase the spirit of the coronavirus.” The authorities should issue clear orders to the security forces that they are to act with restraint while enforcing restrictions in place.''

''On Tuesday, June 9, Kinshasa police used live fire to disperse merchants at the Central Market in Kinshasa. The merchants were trading despite the mandated closure of the market due to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Two people were reportedly killed during the police intervention, although it is not immediately clear if they were shot or trampled by the crowd. The interior minister has halted the cleanup of the market pending an investigation into the incident.''

 The government used police forces to enforce social distancing measures. The police resorted in excess use of violence though, sending many people to the hospital and arresting quite a few individuals.

# Iran 
*Answer*: 2 

*Comments*:
 There are several reports on security forces in engaging in severe violence in reaction to protests and riots at prisons due to the Covid-19 situation, and the inmates incapacity to protect themselves from it spreading. Amnesty International reports that up to 36 inmates have been killed by security forces during these protests.
While no violence in enforcing the emergency measures have been found when it comes to civilians outside the prisons, there are several reports of lethal violence occuring at the hands of security forces in reaction to inmates not following the regulations and protesting on Covid-19 related issues. This is therefore coded as 2.

# Israel 
*Answer*: 0 

*Comments*:
 There are a few isolated reports from regional media outlets like The New Arab and Middle East Eye of a few incidents of non-lethal violence by police when enforcing emergency measures, or at least referencing emergency measures as the reason for that violence. However, no other sources have been found corroborating this, such as Reuters, BBC and other big media outlets. Furthermore, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International has not reported any on this. As there’s no support from such violence occurring in any large and trusted sources, this is coded as 0.
Note also that  the ongoing violence in the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel is not regarded here, as this violence is not connected to the emergency measures, and Covid-19 has not been used as an excuse for such violence by the Israeli government or authorities.

# Jordan 
*Answer*: 0 

*Comments*:
 One press release from Reuters mention Jordan together with 15 other countries as being viewed by UN as cases where there are allegations of state of emergencies being to far reaching, and police violence occuring. However, it is unclear from this whether Jordan is included in this list due to the former (state of emergency allows severe violations of human rights) rather than the latter (violence when enforcing emergency measures). There are no other found reports on any such vilence, for example not from Human Rights Watch or Amnesty International, and no specific reference to any event of police violence in Jordan in the Reuters article, or the initial UN press release.
As there are no concrete reports on any cases of security forces using violence in enforcing emergency measures, and the UN might just refer to Jordan as a case of to far reaching state of emergency, this is coded as 0.

 There are reports of security forces using violence in quelling protests from migrant workers, which are directly related to Covid-19 as these workers have protested being stranded in camps due to Covid-19 not enabling them to travel to their home country.

*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 'Tensions heightened after a police officer allegedly beat a street vendor, accused of violating an afternoon ban on commercial activities. Images of the victim were shared on social media, sparking fury among residents of Toamasina in eastern Madagascar.''
''The police have denied perpetrating any violence and instead allege that the street vendor had returned home following a short visit to the hospital. Protestors burnt tires, blocked roads and threw stones at security forces who, in turn, fired rubber bullets. The protestors claimed that COVID-19 did not exist in the town and the state was manipulating them.''

This is the only incident i found on news reporting.

 Police has clashed with protestors and fired teargas at them. While this is bad, it does not appear that dispersing the protestors were part of any covid-19 emergency measure enforcements.

# Philippines 
*Answer*: 2 

*Comments*:
 People have been punished for violating the curfew and the punishments or penalities have been inhumane. For example

1: Police and local officials in several parts of the country have mistreated people detained for violating COVID-19 regulations, including by confining them to dog cages and forcing them to sit for hours in the midday sun.

2: Two children were locked in a coffin on 26 March 2020 as punishment for violating curfew.

3: In Binondo, Manila, village officials arrested four boys and four girls on March 19 for violating curfew. They forcibly cut the hair of seven of the children while the one who resisted was stripped naked and ordered to walk home.

 There have been reports of the police killing two persons, but it is not very clear whether this was to enforce lockdown measures - rwandan police has rejected these accusations. For this reason, but also because it is only this incident reported, coding is 1 (although allegedly with lethal outcomes).

''Rwandan police shot and killed two people who attacked officers while on routine patrol. “People should not confuse the measures taken to prevent the spread of Covid-19 with this unfortunate incident,” the police said on Twitter.''

# Senegal

*Comments*:
 'In Senegal, where clashes between police and civilians are rare, the first night of a nationwide curfew in late March was marred by violence. Videos posted online showed police swiping at fleeing civilians with batons. Reuters could not verify the footage, but police in a statement apologised for the use of “excessive interventions” and promised to punish officers involved.''
''Footage from Senegal surfaced last week showing policemen beating people found outside after a night curfew. In one video, officials force three young men to do squats after they were caught exercising at night. Police eventually assured that all "excessive interventions" had been punished.''

# Togo 
*Answer*: 2 

*Comments*:
 'On 2 April, President Faure Gnassingbé, Eyadéma’s son, announced a state of emergency and a curfew to go into immediate effect. The government deployed 5,000 soldiers who beat and assaulted civilians that same evening. Photos of a young man who suffered a ghastly eye injury at the hands of security forces went viral within the community. Some expressed sympathy for the victim. Others showed support for the soldiers purportedly doing their jobs. Soon, however, the reports escalated. A video emerged of an old woman who had been severely wounded by soldiers after allegedly violating the curfew. Days later, a young man named Gueli Kodjo Djifa died after being beaten. The minister of security said an epileptic attack was the cause of death, but the family says he was tortured by security forces. This time, there was more public uproar as people realised that injustice meted out on a few can be carried out against all.''

 There are some reports that the Turkish police have used force (tear gas, rubber bullets and detentions) when trying to stop HDP demonstrations against the government.

These are however the only reports of such violence in enforcing the measures that have been found, and this is therefore coded as 1.
