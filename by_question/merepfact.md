# Algeria 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 'One journalist, Khaled Drareni, an editor at the Algerian publication, the Casbah Tribune, was arrested for allegedly "inciting an unarmed gathering and endangering national unity" over his critical Covid-19 coverage. In the past, Drareni had been arrested for his coverage of anti-government protests which had been staged every Friday for more than a year, before it was stopped because of Covid-19.''

# Brazil

*Comments*:
 The government is reducing the amount of information available to the public and the press. President Bolsonaro defends the use of cloroquine without scientific arguments and argues against social isolation. The Minister of Education, Abraham Weintraub, tweeted that covid-19 is part of a "Chinese plan for world domination". Eduardo Bolsonaro (president's son who is a member of parliament and president of the Lower Chambers's Commission on International Relations and National Security) has said that China and the Chinese Communist Party are to blame for the pandemic.

# Burma/Myanmar 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 A journalist has been arrested and jailed for two years for reporting on a person having died of Covid-19, under Article 505 of the Penal Code  stating that spreading information that "cause fear or alarm to the public". This legislation evidently puts de facto limitations on media reporting about Covid-19. Furthermore, Myanmar has also closed down over 200 websites in response to the crisis, many of which were media outlets, claiming that these sites spread "fake news". This is therefore coded as 1.

# Burundi 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 There are widepread reports on lack of transparency from the Burundian authoritiies on covid19 related matters.

''A health ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said seven patients had gone to one hospital with symptoms such as respiratory distress and that a whole wing had been dedicated to them ata military hospital. A doctor, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, reported six deaths of patients “presenting all the symptoms of coronavirus” last week.''

''The UN Commission noted that some humanitarian organisations were refused access to sites where persons were quarantined in deplorable conditions. The quarantined persons should be provided with sufficient food, clean water and access to health facilities and medical services.''

''Human Rights Watch on Tuesday criticized the Burundian government’s performance in dealing with the coronavirus pandemic, accusing it of having a “denial and deflection approach to crisis management”.''
'' “On March 27, a hospital in Bujumbura, the country’s economic capital, alerted the government to three strongly suspected cases, who later reportedly tested negative. Several sources in the medical and humanitarian field have expressed concerns to Human Rights Watch that the authorities are not conducting enough tests to understand the extent to which the disease may be spreading,” said the statement.''

Also, the outgoing president of Burundi has died of a sudden illness, suspected by many to be Covid-19. The cause of Pierre Nkurunziza’s death was described as a heart attack in a government statement....It was unclear exactly when he died. A government statement said the president, a keen sports enthusiast, had attended a game of volleyball on Saturday but fell ill that night and was taken to hospital.''

 Chinese politicians downplayed the severity of the virus in its early weeks prior to 11 March 2020. Police also target “rumourmongers” and censors deleted any commentary that question the official line. On 1 January 2020, the government arrested eight whistle blower doctors accused of spreading rumours about Covid-19.

Fang Bin a textile trader living in Wuhan documented the state of saturation in hospitals in a video that was uploaded on 25 January 2020. He was later arrested and his laptop confiscated for the reporting that he had done.

# Egypt 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 1: The Egyptian health ministry repeatedly labelled a Taiwanese tourist as the source of the outbreak in Luxor, then did not acknowledge nor provide further explanation after Taiwan’s Centre for Disease Control refuted this entirely (with evidence).  

2: There are large discrepancies in the Egyptian governments reporting on the prevalence of Covid-19 in Egypt and the situation as described by other international sources. Eg: Uni of Toronto states that there should have been 6270 to 45050 cases in early March. However the country’s official number at the same point in time was three.

# India 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 1: India had officially stated that there was a change from “local transmission” to “community transmission” on 29 march 2020. However, this information was not shared in the government press release or press conference. It instead continued to publicly maintain that the country was still in the lower phase of limited local transmission. The real information was later leaked to health professionals. 20 Journalists posed ten key questions to the government on this mishandling of information and received no response.

2: The government has attempted to exercise total control over information about Covid-19. On 31 March 2020, it asked the supreme court to direct the media to publish nothing about the epidemic “without first ascertaining the facts from the mechanism provided by the government.” While the courts did not allow this, it made concessions by ruling that, to avoid the dissemination of “unverified news capable of causing panic,” the media must “refer to and publish the official version about the developments” including the government’s daily bulletin.

3: After this, the health ministry’s representatives told reporters that they would only take questions from Asian News International and the state TV broadcaster Doordarshan at the next days press conference. Both news outlets are well known for supporting Modi’s Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP).

4: In May 2020, police registered cases against six journalists in the northern Himachal Pradesh state for reporting about problems faced by migrant workers amid the COVID-19 lockdown. Some reports stated that the stranded laborers did not receive adequate help from the authorities. Police said the reports were "fake" and invoked the Disaster Management Act against the journalists.

 There are no de-facto limitations on media reporting about the nature of the Covid-19 virus. However, there is limited access to Covid-19 related health  information. And there is evidence of policy enforcing laws against dessmination of "hoaxes" concerning Covid-19.

# Laos 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 The decree that regulates the emergency measures states that the government shall "strictly prohibit the advertisement of, release, forward any fake news via any media platform that can cause misunderstanding, panic and create negative impact on society. Task the agency for surveillance and response to the social complaints to closely monitor and strictly take action on those offenders." (Section 6). The decree also states that "the Task Force Committee shall provide detail guidance in a format of an easy understanding to disseminate through official media outlets" (Section 11).
This puts a strong de facto limitation on media reporting on Covid-19 Laos, by making it  punishable to report on anything deemed to cause misunderstanding, panic and negative impact on the society, without any definition on what this constitutes.

''Publishing director and journalist at the Ny Valosoa newspaper Arphine Helisoa was arrested and put in pre-trial detention on 4 April after she was accused of criticizing the president’s handling of the national response to COVID-19 in an article. She is still in detention in Antanimora prison in the country’s capital Antananarivo. She was charged with spreading fake news and incitement of hatred towards President Andry Rajoelina.''

# Malaysia 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 While no reports have been found on journalists being arrested or media outlets shut down for their reporting on Covid-19, journalists have been arrested for their reporting on the governments response to it under Section 505 in the penal code that bans statements that can cause "fear or alarm to the public". As this is vaguely formulated, it poses a de facto threat to media reporting on the nature of Covid-19 as well, and this is therefore coded as 1.

As "false information" is poorly defined, and this law is being enacted and journalists and media outlets face the risk of being prosecuted for "disseminating false information", this is coded as 1, a de facto limitation on reporting on Covid-19.

 Apart from the de jure measures mentioned in melim variable, I havent found other specific limitations on media reporting. 

''The decree enables the government to declare a ""state of health emergency"" and take exceptional measures to stop the spread of disease. Anyone who contravenes the decree that declares a health emergency, or incites others to contravene the decree through speech or threat uttered in a public place or meeting, written or printed materials, photos, posters, audiovisual or electronic communications, or any other means can be imprisoned one to three months or be fined 300 to 1,300 dirhams ($30-$130).''

In a statement on March 22, the Moroccan Ministry of Culture, Youth, and Sports, which oversees the country’s press, ordered all print newspapers to suspend their publication and distribution until further notice, and encouraged print outlets to use alternative methods to deliver the news. (the statement is found in the link in arabic)"

# Nicaragua 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 The government limits media reporting about covid-19 by not being transparent about the situation and not sharing the number of cases, deaths or tests. There are police officers by the hospitals to prevent journalists from filming or speaking with health professionals. Burrials are happening during the night, so citizens won't know about them. Additionally, the government is blocking independent media from participating in press conferences.

# North Korea 
*Answer*: 0 

*Comments*:
 There has been no confirmed cases of Covid-19 in North Korea. However, the official newspaper there has called for “for absolute obedience to state anti-coronavirus guidelines without any exception, warning that punishment will follow if the rules are violated.”

I have also gone through covid-19 related articles listed in the official North Korean newspaper (last link in sources). While the newspaper frequently discusses the number of cases in South Korea, there is no mention of there being any cases in North Korea. There is also no article or discussion on the nature of Covid-19.

*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 The national police commissioner has stated that spreading misinformation on Covid-19 (i.e., its nature, prevalence and the like) will be arrested and charged under Cyber Crime Act. Since what such disinformation constitutes is unclear, and it opens up for journalists being prosecuted for reporting on Covid-19 that is not in line with the governments statements, this constitutes a de facto limitation on Covid-19 and is coded as 1.

 State TV anchor in Congo suspended after asking a minister 'inconvenient question'' about COVID-19 pandemic

Otouna has not been seen on the air since 30 April, when he asked the minister about the lack of information about coronavirus victims, including those currently ill and those who have recovered, and about contradictions between the government’s figures and those given by the president on both the caseload and the lockdown’s economic and social consequences.''
