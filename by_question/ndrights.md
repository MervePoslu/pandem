 There are many reports on  unsanitary conditions of quarantine establishments, but not on violation of non-derogable rights:
''The aid and medical sources said that most sites lack the necessary hygiene and sanitation infrastructure, are severely overcrowded, and raise the risk of the virus spreading unchecked.''
''Although police and local officials have quarantined Burundians and foreigners traveling into the country by air or overland in hotels, schools, and other buildings, Burundian authorities have failed to ensure adequate food, health care, hygiene, and sanitation in some locations. Some humanitarian organizations have been blocked from reaching and providing assistance to people in quarantine.''

# Egypt 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 Article 154 of Egypt’s constitution states that the two requirements needed to call a state of emergency are 

1: The approval by a “majority” of members of the House of Representative

2: The declaration is limited to three months. However this time limit can be extended for a similar period of time after obtaining the approval of two-thirds of the House members. Hence, a state of emergency could be continued indefinitely.

3. In Egypt parliament approved a bill that strengthened the state of emergency in place since 2017 and that already enabled large-scale human flights abuse.

The constitutional stipulation does not mention when and why the President of the Republic is allowed to declare a SoE, as opposed to Article 4 of the ICCPR, which permits derogations from ordinary human rights protections only in “time of public emergency which threatens the life of the nation”.

Article 154 does not specify a geographical limitation on state of emergencies and there is no limitation on the measures adopted under the state of emergency as is the case under Article 4 of the ICCPR, “to the extent strictly required by the exigencies of the situation.”

# El Salvador 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 Security forces have arbitrarily detained hundreds of people who did not respect quarantine measures, even after the supreme court ruled it illegal. This disrespects article 15 (no conviction for a crime which was not a crime at the time of commitment). Also, due to an increase in crime rates, Bukele declared a prision lockdown and authorized the use of lethal force against gang members he said were "taking advantage of the fact security forces were busy helping to contain the virus outbreak", disrespecting article 7 (freedom from torture and cruel/inhuman treatment).

# Morocco 
*Answer*: 0 

*Comments*:
 'The containment measures outlined in the decrees adopted by the Moroccan authorities seem fully in compliance with the limitations imposed by the ACHPR and ICCPR on the enjoyment of these fundamental rights. In particular, they have been adopted by law, with the legitimate aim of protecting public health from a pandemic, and are both necessary and proportionate. In fact, measures limiting social contacts are not only adequate, but have proven to be the only effective measures to limit the spread of COVID-19. Moreover, the measures imposed by the Moroccan government are strictly limited (materially and in time) to the exigencies of the situation.'' (1)

 No evidence of non-derogable right violation. The Supreme Committee Statement from 17/03/2020 defines "Closure of all non-Muslim places of worship", but also "Closure of all mosques with the exception of call to prayers"

# Pakistan 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 Churches and minority worship places were closed to deal with the pandemic. But congregations in mosques were allowed. I have coded this as 1 because the different religions seems to be treated in an unequal manner.

# Philippines 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 People have been punished for violating the curfew and the punishments have been inhumane. For example

1: Police and local officials in several parts of the country have mistreated people detained for violating COVID-19 regulations, including by confining them to dog cages and forcing them to sit for hours in the midday sun.

2: Two children were locked in a coffin on 26 March 2020 as punishment for violating curfew.

3: In Binondo, Manila, village officials arrested four boys and four girls on March 19 for violating curfew. They forcibly cut the hair of seven of the children while the one who resisted was stripped naked and ordered to walk home.

# Sri Lanka 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 The Sri Lankan government have been prohibiting burials which are essential according to Islam. As such Muslims who have died from Covid-19 related deaths have been forcibly cremated on the instructions of the authorities and against the wishes of the deceased families. The WHO’s guidelines for the safe management of dead bodies in the context of Covid-19 allows for both burials and cremations.

# United Arab Emirates 
*Answer*: 0 

*Comments*:
 The emergency measures have not de-jure violated non-derogable rights as defined by the ICCPR. Although certain parts of the population such as prison inmates and migrant workers, are suffering more from the pandemic, this is not as a result of the emergency measures (but perhaps a result of lack of certain measures to protect vulnerable groups), and is therefore not included in this score.
