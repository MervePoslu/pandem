# Algeria 
*Answer*: 4 

*Comments*:
 Algeria adopted several gradual measures through decrees. The decrees are based on the Constitution and other legal acts, but the articles on which they are based are not related to emergency powers, but rather ''normal'' lawming powers. 
For example, the decrees  No. 20-69 of March 21, 2020, and 20-70 of March 24, 2020 refer legally to the Constitution, articles 99-4° and 143, or the law n° 88-07 du 7 Joumada Ethania 1408 correspondant au 26 janvier 1988 relative à l’hygiène, à la sécurité et à la médecine du travail ; 

Article 99 (4) of the Cosntitution: 
In addition to the powers explicitly conferred upon him by other provisions of the Constitution, the Prime Minister shall exercise the following functions:
4. he shall sign the executive decrees;

Art 143: Matters other than those earmarked for statutory legislation shall fall within the regulatory power of the President of the Republic. The implementation of the laws shall be a matter for the regulatory field of the Prime Minister

''Faced with the Covid-19 health crisis and the development of cases affecting the country, the Algerian Government has gradually taken a series of general measures aimed at containing the spread of the virus. These measures have been the subject of two main texts:

Executive Decree No. 20-69 of March 21, 2020 relating to measures to prevent and combat the spread of Coronavirus (Covid-19) and, the purpose of which is to establish measures of social distancing intended to prevent and combat the spread of COVID-19;
 
Executive Decree No. 20-70 of March 24, 2020 establishing additional measures to prevent and combat the spread of Coronavirus (Covid-19) and which has as its object the establishment of containment devices, restriction of circulation, framing of citizens' trade and supply activities, of rules of distancing as well as the methods of citizen mobilization in the national effort to prevent and combat the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic.''

# Austria 
*Answer*: 4 

*Comments*:
 Austria has a state of emergency legislation, but this has not been used. Instead, Austria have implemented a set of new laws (Covid-19 Law, Second Covid-19 Law and then subsequent legislation for the reopening of Austra) within the existing legal framework. Through the new laws, the government has been given an extraordinary set of powers to address Covid-19, and this is therefore coded as 4.

# Bangladesh 
*Answer*: 7 

*Comments*:
 Bangladesh did not declare a state of emergency. It instead declared a country-wide ‘general holiday’ which was imposed for two weeks from 26 March. This was later extended until 5 May. The scope of ‘general holiday’ was extensive with the closure of all government and private offices, schools and universities and subject to stringent exceptions, all courts including the Supreme Court. 

Whenever any new COVID-19 case is detected, the concerned suburb, village or district is placed under ‘lockdown’ which is often done by an oral administrative order, so it is possible to have both a ‘public holiday’ and also a ‘lockdown’ as emergency measures taken at  the same time.

# Belgium 
*Answer*: 4 

*Comments*:
 Belgium used Article 105 of the Constitution to invoke Special powers to the executive in order to pass legislation dealing with Covid19 (1; 2; 3).
Based on the above, two covid19 laws were passed: Article 3 of Law COVID-19 (I) (No 1104/5), and Article 5 of Law COVID-19 (II) (No 1104/6). 
However, before these two main legal instruments there were a series of laws for the first measures: On 13 March, a ministerial decree signed by the Interior Minister prohibited a number of cultural, recreational and sporting activities, while also closing down schools and restaurants, inter alia. Stricter measures were introduced by ministerial decrees on 18 March and 23 March (including social distancing, distance learning and teleworking for non-essential business); these were further clarified on 24 March and modified on 17 April.

# Benin 
*Answer*: 6 

*Comments*:
 Beninese government implemented different measures gradually, but these did not apply to the whole territory (no national-level response). The first 11 measures that we taken at the Council of Ministers on march 17, 2020, were general in nature and applied to the national level. Also, their duration was indefinite. But the more ''strict'' measures, i.e. the covid19 health cordon , applied to the affected areas. 

Health cordon: taken on March 23, is established to count from Monday March 30, 2020 at 00h, a sanitary cordon around the municipalities most exposed to the pandemic that are Cotonou, Abomey-Calavi, Allada, Ouidah, Sèmè-Podji, Porto-Novo, Akpro-Missérété and Adjarra to isolate them from the rest of the country. 

''On April 14, more municipalities were added to the health cordon: After the evaluation of the measures taken by the Government as part of the response to the CORONAVIRUS pandemic (Covid-19), the cordon cordon established as of March 30, 2020 is maintained until Monday April 27, 2020 at midnight.''

''The said cordon is extended to new localities and now includes the following municipalities: Cotonou, Abomey-Calavi, Allada, Ouidah, Tori-Bossito, Kpomassè, Toffo, Zè, Sô-Ava, Aguégués, Sèmè-Podji, Porto-Novo, Akpro -Missérété, Adjara, and Atchoukpa (municipality of Avrankou).''

*Comments*:
 The Burkinabe Council declared a state of health alert in accordance with article 66 of the Public Health Code (1994), which states: 

''Article 66. — En vue d’enrayer tout danger de propagation des maladies transmissibles, il pourrait être pris un décret sur proposition du Ministre chargé de la Santé, instituant l’état d’alerte sanitaire dans une localité ou une région ; dans ce cas, des mesures obligatoires d’hygiène et de prophylaxie sont appliquées durant une période déterminée et renouvelable au besoin.'' The Council also decided to issue a decree on quarantine for a period of 2 weeks, to count from Friday March 27, 2020 at 7 am, of all the cities or localities having registered a positive case with the covid-19. ''The declaration of the state of health alert was made in accordance with article 66 of the law N ° 23/94 / ADP of May 19, 1994 in deliberative form in council of ministers on March 26 2020 and made known to the public by means of a ''press release'' from the Minister responsible for communication. However, the law requires that such a declaration be made by "decree", and not by a "press release", which has not happened.''

# Burma/Myanmar 
*Answer*: 5 

*Comments*:
 Myanmar has a state of emergency legislation in the constitution (Chapter XI), but this has not been used. Maynmar has however had a national level emergency response, for example closing borders, imposing curfews and restricting gatherings. No reference has been found to any existing or new legislation in these meaures, and this is therefore coded as 5 - a national level emergency response without specific reference to a legal instrument.

# Canada 
*Answer*: 6 

*Comments*:
 Canada has a state of emergency law, the Emergency Act, but this has not been activated. Instead, the government uses existing legal framework such as the Quarantine Act, Human Pathongen and Toxins Act, Public Health Act and Public Health Agency of Canada Act to mitigate the spread of Covid-19. Furthermore, they have approved laws relating to Covid-19 (Covid-19 Emergency Response Act 1 and 2) but these are not emergency measures that affect any democratic rights, but only provide financial aid to different sectors and groups. The emergency response, and declarations of states of emergency, have instead been conducted more or less entirely at the provincial level. Therefore, this is coded as 6, i.e. they have no national level emergency response because that response is handled by the provinces.

 Central African Republic took a series of gradual measures, without a specific reference to a legal instrument. The measures were announced through Press Releases.

''It was also highlighted that the Government seemed to refer to the Constitution primarily for electoral purposes instead of invoking it for addressing the country’s urgent needs due to the disastrous impact of COVID-19.  The Constitution indeed authorises the President to declare a state of emergency or use ‘exceptional powers’ in exceptional circumstances. Declaring a state of emergency would have allowed the National Assembly to enact a public health emergency law to address the effects of the pandemic. However, the government did not make use of these provisions - or any specific law - as a basis for the de facto emergency measures that it imposed on the population.''

# China 
*Answer*: 6 

*Comments*:
 China has a four-tier response system for public health emergencies that determines what measures a region will implement, with level I the most serious. Officials in the different regions are separately in charge of their own areas. The emergency response law is triggered when the region goes into level 1. However, the measures that can be taken according to the emergency response law is very vague (Third source link).

# Denmark

*Comments*:
 The Danish government proposed an amedment to the Act on Measures against
Infectious and Other Communicable Diseases (Epidemiloven) that grants the Minister of Health powers that include limiting gatherings of people, prohibiting access to means of transportation and order people who are suspected of being infected to isolate.
This amendment is the legal instrument through which the initial emergency measures were taken, and this is therefore coded as 4.

 Egypt has been under a nationwide state of emergency since April 2017. It was extended for the 12th time on 28 April 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. On 22 April 2020, amendments were made to the 1958 Emergency Law (No. 162/1958) which gives sweeping powers to the president and security agencies. 

It has been extended every three months, at six month intervals to avoid violating the constitution.

# France 
*Answer*: 2 

*Comments*:
 On Monday March 23, 2020, the French Parliament adopted an emergency law establishing a “health state of emergency,” or a sanitary emergency, declared for a period of two months from March 24, 2020 to May 24, 2020 (Emergency Law No. 2020-290 of March 23, 2020 to deal with the Covid-19 epidemic) (the “Emergency Law”). (6)
''The French Constitution (1958) and primary law deals with emergency situations by virtue of three sets of provisions, i) 'presidential exceptional powers' (Article 16 of the Constitution), ii) the 'state of siege' (Article 36 of the Constitution and Article L. 2121-1 of the Defence Code),  and iii) the 'state of emergency' (Law No 55-385 of 1955). 
Despite this existing legal framework, the Emergency Law No. 2020-290 of March 23, 2020 is new legislation. This law adds several provisions to the nation’s Public Health Code, allowing the executive to declare a “state of health emergency” (état d’urgence sanitaire) in all or part of the country, and defining what that entails. A state of health emergency allows the government to severely curtail certain liberties in order to fight a pandemic or similar public health emergency. ''
The new Emergency Law is temporary, and it is due to expire entirely by April 1, 2021. It also needs the approval of the legislature if it is going to be implemented for more than 1 month.

# Gabon 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 Gabon declared a state of emergency on April 10, 2020. On 11 May the state of emergency was lifted, and replaced by a new law allowing the government to take emergency measures without declaring a state of emergency. The law gives the government similar powers as a state of emergency for an additional 45 days.

Article 25, Constitution (1991): 
''The President may, when circumstances require it, after deliberation with the Council of Ministers and consultation of the Bureaus of the National Assembly and the Senate, proclaim by decree a state of urgency or a state of siege, that will confer to the President special powers within the conditions determined by the law.''

''Requested by the President of the Republic, Head of State Ali Bongo Ondimba in the Senate and accompanied in this process by Julien Nkoghe Bekale, by a referral to the Constitutional Court for opinion having regard to the context, on the declaration of the state of 'emergency in Gabon, the Council of Ministers meeting this Thursday has in agreement with the executive issued the decree declaring the state of emergency.''

# Germany 
*Answer*: 6 

*Comments*:
 The emergency measures taken toward Covid-19 are primarly done by the German states, and the federal government acts as a coordinating unit. Furthermore, the German constitution includes a state of emergency-clause,  but this has not been activated (different types of states of emergency has however been enacted at the state level). The main emergency measures have been taken under the Infectious Diseases Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz), which is a federal law, but the adoption of the measures is taken by the states under this Law, not the federal government. It is worth noting that the federal government has taken several measures, not least in subsequently ammending the Infectious Diseases Act and also passing financial aid packages, but the primary emergency response exists at the state level, and this is therefore coded as 6.

# Greece 
*Answer*: 4 

*Comments*:
 The greek Constitution (1) has provisions both for state of emergency (called state of siege, art. 48 of 2008 revision of the 1975 contistution), which however applies strictly to war, and for giving extraordinary powers to the executive in all other emergency situations other than war. It is this article that was invoked, art 44 of the Constitution, which gives the executive the power to ''fast-track'' law-making, by the so-called ''Acts of Legislative Content''.

# Guinea 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 On Friday, March 27, President Alpha Condé announced a nationwide state of emergency due to the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19) in the country.

Constitution art 90; ''The state of siege, as the state of urgency, is decreed by the President of the Republic, after the opinion [après avis] of the President of the National Assembly and of the President of the Constitutional Court. These opinions are published in the Journal Officiel [Official Gazette]. 
The President of the Republic may take, by ordinance, all measures necessary to the defense of the integrity of the territory and to the restoration or to the maintenance of the public order. 
The National Assembly meets then of plain right, if it is not in session. It may not be dissolved.
The decree proclaiming the state of siege or the state of urgency ceases to be in force after twelve days, unless the National Assembly, referred to [the matter] by the President of the Republic, authorizes its [en] prorogation for a time period that it establishes. The Ordinances taken in application of the state of siege and of the state of urgency cease to be in force at the end of them.''

# Haiti 
*Answer*: 2 

*Comments*:
 Haiti declared a state of health emergency through an executive decree (1; 2). 

The President is ruling by decree since January 2020, because the elections that were supposed take place in October 2019 were not held, therefore the mandate of the Haitian legislature expired on January 13, 2020, and even since no legislature exists (7). 

The Constitution has a clause on states of emergency but there wasn't any legal reference to it in the measures taken (8). 

''After the confirmation of two cases of Coronavirus COVID-19 in Haiti, the President of the Republic Jovenel Moïse in a decree taken in the Council of Ministers declared a state of health emergency on the whole of the national territory for a period of a month.''

# India 
*Answer*: 3 

*Comments*:
 India has not declared a state of emergency. Instead on 24 March 2020, the central government invoked the National Disaster Management Act. It has declared Covid-19 to be a ‘disaster’ within Section 10 of the NDMA. This authorizes the National Disaster Management Authority to issue binding directions and guidelines to the several state governments, for the purposes of addressing a disaster. It centralizes the sphere of operations, giving the federal government overriding powers of enforcement.

# Iran 
*Answer*: 5 

*Comments*:
 Iran has a state of emergency legislation in their constitution (Article 79), but this has not been activated. They have implented several emergency measures, such as curfews, school closings, closing religious and public places and so on, but this has not been in reference to any such legal instrument.
This is therefore coded as 5, Iran has a national level emergency response but without any specific legal instrument for those emergency measures.

# Iraq 
*Answer*: 5 

*Comments*:
 Iraq has a state of emergency legislation in their constitution (Article 61), but this has not been activated. Iraq has however had a national-level emergency response, including curfews, school closings and closing of public places, to which no reference to any legal instrument has been found.

# Ireland 
*Answer*: 4 

*Comments*:
 Ireland has an emergency legislation, but it only allows for declaring states of emergency "in time of war or armed rebellion". The Irish government and parliament thus made a substantial amendment to the existing Health Act (the amendment is called Preservation and Protection and other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) which gives the Minister of Health power to restrict gatherings, implement lockdowns, travel restrictions and the like. The main national level emergency response has thus been taken under this legal instrument, which is a new amendment, and therefore coded as 4.

# Italy 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 A State of Emergency was declared by the Italian Government on 31 January, with reference to the Legislative Decree No. 1 of 2 January 2018. This is thus not a constitutional state of emergency, but one taken with under regular legislation.
Note that a number of decrees also have been issued after this to perform a number of emergency measures, but the initial emergency response is this declaration of a state of emergency.

 The ICNL mentions that Kenya declared a state of a public health emergency, although it is not explicitly mentioned as such in none of the government sources neither in journalistic accounts. However, it is the closest to the coding options provided. All the introduced measures refer legally to the Public Health Act (Sections 35 and 36) and the Public Order (State Curfew) Order 2020, effected by Legal Notice No. 36 of the Kenya Gazette Notice of 26th March 2020.

# Kuwait 
*Answer*: 5 

*Comments*:
 Kuwait has issued a number of measures (e.g. curfews, closing of schools and workplaces, restricting religious gatherings), with many of these starting on March 12. But there is no mention of any state of emergency having been declared, or any legal instrument being referred to when implementing these measures. Garda and the U.S. Embassy for example makes no mention of any such state of emergency, and ACAPS who records all policies taken during the crisis has no mentioning of declaring of a state of emergency. Therefore, this is coded as 5 as there is a national level emergency response, but no legal instrument or declared state of emergency.

# Laos 
*Answer*: 4 

*Comments*:
 The Prime Minister issued a decree that specifies and regulates the main emergency measures in Laos, for example public gatherings, public transport, border closure etc. This is not taken in reference to any state of emergency or existing regulations, and is thus regarded as adopting a new law.

# Lebanon 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 Lebanon declared a state of emergency on March 16, according to several sources. Sources like  Garda, UNDP, ACAPS and Human Rights Watch regard it a state of emergency rather than a public health emergency or state of disaster. Furthermore, ACAPS state that: "The Government invoked Article 2 of 1983 National Defense Law, which stipulates that the Government may declare general mobilization when a threat is endangering the population.".
Consequently, this  is coded as a state of emergency within existing legal framework.

# Lesotho 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 Lesotho declared a state of emergency over the coronavirus pandemic retrospectively on March 28, 2020, to be in force from March 18, and then again on April 15, 2020. He had, in the meantime, prorogued the Parliament on March 19. 

It is a bit unlcear what was the situation between the two declarations of state of emergency: 

''...onn Friday 27 March 2020, the Prime Minister pursuant to s 23(1) of the Constitution retrospectively declared a state of emergency from 18 March 2020. As shown above, since s 23(2) of the Constitution prescribes that a declaration of state of emergency automatically lapses at the expiration of 14 days from the date on which it was declared. It means that the state of emergency automatically lapsed on 8 April 2020 unless extended by Parliament....Lesotho is not the only country in the region that confers powers to the head of the executive to declare a state of emergency without parliamentary approval.''

''As alluded to earlier, the Prime Minister has the power to declare the state of emergency without the approval of Parliament. However, only Parliament has the power to extend such a declaration from the initial 14 days. The problem in Lesotho is that the state of emergency was declared at a time when Parliament was prorogued. This means that there was no constitutional authority to extend the state of emergency beyond the 14 days that the Prime Minister is allowed to establish. Realizing this constitutional reality, on 15 April 2020, the Prime Minister re-declared the state of emergency from 15 April 2020 to 28 April 2020. Whilst this was legally correct under those circumstances, it does raise questions about the legal position that persisted between 8 April and 15 April 2020. Was there a state of emergency during this period? Were the things done or enforced during this period constitutionally sanctioned? The answers to some of these or other questions remain unclear and may never be found.''

Constitution (1993), section 23 (1).
23. Declaration of emergency - 1. In time of war or other public emergency which threatens the life of the nation, the Prime Minister may, acting in accordance with the advice of the Council of State, by proclamation which shall be published in the Gazette, declare that a state of emergency exists for the purposes of this Chapter.

''In addition to s 23 of Constitution, Parliament has enacted statutes that enable the state to implement a state of emergency situations. Among these statutes is the Emergency Powers Act of 1988 and the Disaster Management Act 2 of 1997. Section 23 of the Constitution is read and implemented together with the Emergency Powers Act and the Disaster Management Act.''

# Libya 
*Answer*: 5 

*Comments*:
 Several sources like Garda, ACAPS, the US State Department and a Libyan Health Sector response report (co-written by WHO and UN among others) all report that Libya declared a state of emergency on March 14, but none of the sources refer to any legal instrument under which this was declared. Furthermore, the Libyan constitution does not include a state of emergency, so this could not have been taken under any article in the constitution.
Since there's no reference to any legal instrument in any of the sources reporting on this, and no  government or legal sources stating any legal instrument has been found, this is coded as 5: a national level emergency response without reference to specific legal instrument.

# Malaysia 
*Answer*: 4 

*Comments*:
 Malaysia has a state of emergency legislation in their constitution (Article 150), but this has not been used. Instead, the government has issued emergency measures and regulations under The Prevention and Control of Diseases Act 1988, which puts the Minister of Health in charge and allows him/her to issue regulations. The most significant such regulation instituted under this law is the Movement Control Order, which was put in effect on March 20 and regulates freedom of movement, association, closing of public places, bussiness and borders, and the like. As these are new regulations enacted by the government through an existing legal instrument, this is coded as 4.

# Mali 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 "In addition to the state of emergency which prevails in our country due to the security context, the state of health emergency is decreed. A curfew is also decreed. It will be rigorously applied from 9 p.m. to 5 a.m., until further notice, starting at midnight on Thursday, March 26, 2020, " President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita.

Constitution, articles 49, 50, 72, 74, accompanied by law 2017 055 of November 6, 2017 on the state of emergency and state of siege.
Coded as 1 instrad of 2 because the Constitution does not offer a distinct provision for a state of health emergency, despite the fact that what was officially declared was a state of health emergency (the constitution articles looks as if they allow for adjusted language to the nature of the crisis (e.g. “state of siege”) as warranted.

# Mauritania 
*Answer*: 4 

*Comments*:
 In Mauritania, the government in mid-March 2020, took various gradual measures which were announced through Press Releases (Communiqués).  However, on April 1, 2020, the Council of Ministers invoked article 60 of the Constitution (1991), which gives special powers to the government for a limited period of time: 

''Article 60 -After the agreement of the President of the Republic, the Government can, for the execution of its program, demand of the Parliament the authorization of taking by ordinance, for a limited period, the measures that are normally of the domain of the law. These ordinances are taken in the Council of Ministers and require the approval of the President of the Republic[,] who signs them. They enter into force as soon as they are published, but they become lapsed if the Bill of the law of ratification is not deposited before [devant] the Parliament before [avant] the date established by the enabling law. At the expiration of the time mentioned in the first paragraph of this Article, the ordinances cannot be modified[,] except by the law[,] in the matters that are of the legislative domain. The enabling law lapses if the National Assembly is dissolved.''

''Council of Ministers: Approval of a bill authorizing the Government to take all the measures necessary to fight against the Covid pandemic19. - Nouakchott, 04/01/2020
The Council under the Chairmanship of His Excellency Mohamed Ould Cheikh El-Ghazouani, President of the Republic, examined and approved a draft enabling law authorizing the Government, in application of article 60 of the Constitution, to take by ordinances during a limited time, all the necessary measures, which are normally of the domain of the law, to fight the Covid pandemic19. 
This bill is part of the actions initiated by the Government to protect our populations against the spread of Covid19 which is wreaking havoc in several countries of the world.
It will consolidate the efforts undertaken since the onset of this exceptional and unprecedented pandemic, by giving the Government the flexibility and the related legal instruments to act with the required speed and in a timely manner.

The first measures were taken on March 15, when 
''The Prime Minister and an Interministerial Committee announce their decision to suspend all events and demonstrations, and restrict border crossings.''
-On March 18, a night curfew was put in place.
-On March 28, the Mauritanian government announced that as of Sunday, March 29 at 12:00 noon,  all road traffic and movement of persons between the wilayas (regions) is prohibited, except for health workers, service delivery missions (e.g., water, electricity, telecommunications) and the transportation of goods.

# Mongolia 
*Answer*: 4 

*Comments*:
 The Mongolian constitution has a state of emergency clause that has not been used. Instead, Mongolia initially took a string of emergency measures (border closure, school closure etc.) without any such state of emergency, and have later passed the Law on Covid-19 Prevention. This law authorizes the government to "take necessary measures, such as calling quarantine and traffic movement and time limits, as well as approving relevant regimes, procedures, and instructions to be followed during the COVID 19 pandemic.". This is therefore coded as 4.

# Morocco 
*Answer*: 2 

*Comments*:
 'Based on Article 81 of the Moroccan Constitution, in extraordinary cases of necessity and emergency, the government can adopt decrees having the force of law, which are immediately binding on adoption, but require parliamentary approbation.'' 
On March 23, 2020, the parliament adopted the bills 2.20.292 / 2.20.293 establishing the state of health emergency on the national territory and empowering the government, to take all measures aimed at the containment of COVID-19. The state of health emergency took effect from March 20, 2020.

# Nepal 
*Answer*: 7 

*Comments*:
 Nepal never went into a state of emergency. The relevant legal document in this case has been the Infectious Disease Control Act 1964. Section 2(1) of the Act enables the Government of Nepal to take ‘necessary action’ and ‘issue necessary orders applicable to the general public or a group of any persons’ to ‘root out or prevent’ the development or spread of an infectious disease.

The Act is rather broad. Section 2(1) can, in theory, provide legal foundation for any government action taken to tackle COVID-19—both moderate and extraordinary.

# Netherlands 
*Answer*: 6 

*Comments*:
 The Netherlands has a State of Emergency Act in their constitution (Article 103), but this has not been used. Instead, they have used a mixed set of policies and legal instruments to handle the Covid-19 pandemic. The main emergency measures have been taken under the Safety Regions Act (Wet Veiligheidregio’s), which allows 25 "safety regions" to enforce a number of emergency measures given that the there's a significant public health threat, which in turn is regulated in the  Public Health Act. 
While the government coordinates a substantial amount of the emergency responses (the measures taken by the regions is more or less identical), the implementation and decision making lies at the regional level. Therefore, this is coded as 6 - no national-level emergency response - since the main legal instrument puts decision making and implementation at the regional level.

# Niger 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 Niger declared a nationwide state of emergency through a decree. 
To be noted that in some sources it is mentioned as a State of Public Health Emergency, and the President himself described it in a speech as such, but in most official government sources it is described as a State of Emergency. 
Also, the constitution does not differentiate between a state of emergency and a state of health emergency, but instead has provisions only for a state of emergency (therefore coded as 1).

# Nigeria 
*Answer*: 4 

*Comments*:
 Nigeria has called upon emergency powers to deal with COVID-19 without, however, having declared a state of emergency. The extant Infectious Diseases Law – the Quarantine Act 1926 – gives the President sweeping powers towards preventing the introduction into and spread in Nigeria, and the transmission from Nigeria, of dangerous infectious diseases” and to make regulations for associated purposes.

# North Korea 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 A state of emergency was declared on 30 January 2020 and the anti-epidemic headquarters was established around the country. It’s borders were shut in late January and quarantined all diplomats in Pyongyang for a month. 

North Korea claims that it has not had a single case of Covid-19. While this is highly unlikely, there hasn't been a need for additional emergency responses. There has been no new introductions after 11 March 2020.

# Philippines 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 A national state of calamity was declared across the Philippines on 16 March 2020. This stays in effect for six months. On 23 March 2020, President Duterte enacted the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act. This “authorizes the president to exercise powers necessary to carry out urgent measures to meet the current national emergency related to Covid-19 only for three months unless extended by Congress. The act would allow President Duterte to "reallocate, realign, and reprogram" a budget of almost 275 billion ($5.37 billion) from the estimated 438 billion ($8.55 billion) national budget approved for 2020, in response to the pandemic; enable him to "temporarily take over or direct the operations" of public utilities and privately owned health facilities and other necessary facilities "when the public interest so requires" for quarantine, the accommodation of health professionals, and the distribution and storage of medical relief; and "facilitate and streamline" the accreditation of testing kits. 

2: A COVID-19 law that went into effect on March 24 grants the administration broad powers to address the coronavirus, which has contributed to violations of human rights, including the right to life, freedom of expression, access to information, and children’s rights.

# Republic of the Congo 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 The national government of the Republic of the Congo declared a "state of health emergency" on March 28th (to enter into force from March 31) 2020 through a presidential decree. 

Constitution (2015), articles 93, 157 (provisions on state of emergency). Coded as 1 instrad of 2 because the Constitution does not offer a distinct provision for a state of health emergency,despite the fact that what was officially declared was a state of health emergency (the constitution articles looks as if the allow for adjusted language to the nature of the crisis (e.g. “state of siege”) as warranted.

# Rwanda 
*Answer*: 5 

*Comments*:
 Rwanda did not declare a state of emergency, nor took measures based on a specific legal instrument. The government announced several measures, which were taken gradually.
''In early March a taskforce was assembled and guidelines were issued on 6 March on social distancing and handwashing, and hand sanitiser was placed outside all major public buildings and shopping centres. Testing began well before the first COVID-19 case, which was verified on 14 March.''  

On March 14, the government announced new measures: 
''Statement on New Measures to Prevent COVID-19 Coronavirus Transmission
14 March 2020
Following assessment by the Ministry of Health, the following measures shall be observed for an initial
period of two weeks in order to further strengthen the country’s ability to mitigate the risk of COVID19 coronavirus transmission:
• Places of worship are closed from Sunday 15 March 2020, with prayers to be conducted from
home
• Schools and higher education institutions (both public and private) shall close on Monday 16
March 2020
• Employees should be permitted to work from home wherever possible, in consultation with
their employers
• Large gatherings such as weddings and sporting events are to be postponed, and the number
of people attending burial ceremonies should be minimised
• Businesses and restaurants continue to operate, but adequate distance between customers
must be maintained (at least 1 meter)
• Unnecessary movements should be avoided, and public transport must not be overcrowded''.

On March 21, the government announced enhanced measures, including a 2-week lockdown:
''Rwanda put on 2-week lockdown from March 21 11:59 pm. Inter-city travel banned. Only food-selling stores, gas stations and pharmacies to operate. All workers both private and public to work from home except for essential services. All Borders are closed''

# Saudi Arabia 
*Answer*: 5 

*Comments*:
 The Saudi Arabian government have taken many emergency measures, such as curfews, lockdowns of some areas and regions, travel bans, border closure and closing of religious and public places.
However, this has been without any declared state of emergency, and there's no reference to specific legal instruments under which these actions are taken in the source, nor that they have adopted any new laws.
This is therefore coded as 5.

# Sweden 
*Answer*: 4 

*Comments*:
 The government proposed an amendment to the Comunicable Disease Act (Temporary authorisations in the Communicable Diseases Act due to the virus causing covid-19) that parliament passed, which allows the government to impose temporary restrictions on gatherings and temporary closing of schools, business, public places and transport. This is thus a new regulation that gives government capacity for some emergency measures related to Covid-19, and is therefore coded as 4.

# Switzerland 
*Answer*: 4 

*Comments*:
 Switzerland has adopted new regulation (Ordinance 1 and 2 on measures to combat the coronavirus (COVID-19)). The first was imposed on February 28, and the second on March 13. It is the second regulation that is here considered the main legal instrument, as it allowed farther reaching emergency measures and the one under which the main response such as closing of shools and public places and curfews were taken.
The regulations enacted are based in the Epidemics Act and the Swiss Constitution, but is a new legislation and is therefore coded as 4.

# Taiwan 
*Answer*: 2 

*Comments*:
 Taiwan never went into a state of emergency.

The Special Act for Prevention, Relief and Revitalization Measures for Severe Pneumonia with Novel Pathogens was passed in Taiwan’s legislative Yuan on 25 Feb 2020. It authorizes government expenditure on relief compensation and economic stimulus in fighting the current Covid-19 pandemic. In addition to providing economic relief, the Special Act prescribes penalties for price gouging, carriers or suspected carriers endangering others, misinformation and violation of isolation or quarantine orders during the coronavirus pandemic.

At the same time, most of the government’s actions have been authorized under the previously adopted legislation in particular the Communicable Disease Control Act 
and the Disaster Prevention and Protection Act, rather than the Special Act. Hence, this has been coded as 2.

# Togo 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 The president, in his address to the people, declared a three-month nationwide "health emergency,"on April 1, and a six-month period of exceptional lawmaking authority under Article 86 (and 94) of the Constitution. (1)
Before the president's declaration, on March 30, 2020, the Togolese National Assembly passed Law No. 2020-005 (2), empowering the Government to take measures under the law by Ordinance. Thus in his address to the Nation of April 1, 2020, the Head of State decreed a state of health emergency, which will be sanctioned by the April 2020 Ordinance determining the conditions of implementation of the state of emergency in Togo, itself ratified by decree N ° 2020-024 declaring a state of health emergency.
Yet, although the provisions of article 86 of the constitution provide that “the law fixes the rules concerning (…) the state of siege and the state emergency ”crossed with those of article 94 according to which“ organic law determines the conditions of implementation of the state of siege or the state of emergency , according to critics (see source 7, 8), ''the organic law is otherwise non-existent, at least not found.''
Also, the same critics (mainly source 8), question the legitimacy of the state of emergency in Togo, despite the constitution having such provisions, and despite the president citing the respective articles of the Constitution:

''As a reminder, the National Assembly adopted on March 27, in accordance with article 86 of the Constitution, a law empowering the Government to take, for a period of six months, measures within the domain of the law to combat spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19) and protect the population from the risks of contamination. In his address to the nation on 1 st April, the head of state declared a public health emergency for a period of three months. However, the publication of the decree on the state of emergency is still desired. The consequence is that since the speech of the Head of State, Togo is under a de facto state of emergency.
...''These measures, which, moreover, are taken in simple press releases, have no legal basis. This results in a lot of confusion and a lack of coherence and coordination in the measures taken....''
''Article 94 paragraph 5 of the Constitution provides that " an organic law determines the conditions for implementing the state of siege and the state of emergencymore than necessary to find a legal basis for the measures likely to be taken. To do this, and in the face of the emergency, the Government took advantage of the enabling law of March 30 to define the legal framework for the state of emergency by ordinance.''

Coded as 1 instread of 2 because the Constitution does not offer a distinct provision for a state of health emergency, despite the fact that what was officially declared was a state of health emergency (the constitution articles looks as if it allows for adjusted language to the nature of the crisis (e.g. “state of siege”) as warranted.

# Turkey 
*Answer*: 4 

*Comments*:
 The Turkish constitution allows for the declaration of a state of emergency (as does the Law on the State of Emergency [Law no. 2935]), but such action requires that all emergency presidential decrees be sent to Parliament the same day, debated and resolved within three months otherwise they are considered repealed. Turkey has not adopted a state of emergency, rather the executive has issued decrees with reference to ordinary laws -- Law on the Protection of Public Health (Law no. 1593) and the Law on Provincial Administration (Law no. 5442) -- thereby avoiding legislative approval. A prior Constitutional Court judgement in 2016 allows for vague adoption of measures related to emergencies.

*Answer*: 4 

*Comments*:
 The UK governmet has enacted two new sets of regulations, the The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions)  Regulations 2020, and the Coronavirus Act. Both enable several emergency measures related to Covid-19. The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) is here counted as the main legislation, as it provides the main limitations on freedom of movement, gathering and the closing of public places and business. Noteworthy is also that there are four separate such regulations for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, but the regulations are very similar and provides the same emergency measures capacity across the UK.
This is a new law, and not a state of emergency declaration, and is therefore coded as 4.

# United States of America 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 The US government made a declaration under the National Emergency Act, stating that "the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States constitutes a national emergency". Consequently, this is regarded a declaration of state of emergency, within the existing legal framework.
