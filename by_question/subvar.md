 Initial measures were the same for the whole country. The easing of restrictions varies depending on the municipality, with some municipalities designated as "green areas" from 27 April in the first wave (https://www.kryeministria.al/newsroom/hapja-ne-zonat-e-gjelberta-faze-pilotimi-ne-zonat-me-rrezik-te-ulet-te-perhapjes-se-infeksionit/) and from 4 May in the second wave (https://www.kryeministria.al/newsroom/plani-i-ri-i-masave-lehtesuese-ne-11-maj-nis-faza-e-dyte-e-rihapjes/)

 'The various measures are applicable throughout the national territory for a period which was brought to this stage to April 19. Failure to comply with them is liable to result in administrative sanctions (immediate withdrawal of administrative authorizations to carry out activities) and criminal sanctions without these being expressly defined.''

The partial measures - lockdowns, curfews, etc vary subnationally.

 While it is the states and territories that enforce and control many of the emergency measures, the coordination through the National Cabinet (the federal government and all state and territories cooperation unit) is in place to coordinate and integrate the response to Covid-19, and the sub-national variation seems to be fairly small.

 'On 17 March 2020, even before the federal parliament did, the parliament of the Walloon Region granted sweeping special powers.''...the Walloon parliament even granted powers in case it would be adjourned because of COVID 19....On 17 March 2020, the parliament of the French Community too adopted special powers legislation, although these were more limited with regard to their object and focused on education measures. On 19 March 2020, the parliamentary institutions in Brussels-Capital followed suit, granting special powers with regard to virtually all areas of regional and community competences and which are impacted by the crisis. In Flanders, no special powers have been granted so far. On 18 March 2020, the Flemish parliament itself adopted emergency measures with regard to urban planning requirements, anticipating the short-term construction of hospitals and other care facilities.'' There is subnational variation in certain measures and dates when these measures were adopted, based on each Province and Region.

# Benin 
*Answer*: 3 

*Comments*:
 Beninese government implemented different measures gradually, but these did not apply to the whole territory (no national-level response). The first 11 measures that we taken at the Council of Ministers on march 17, 2020, were general in nature and applied to the national level. Also, their duration was indefinite. But the more ''strict'' measures, i.e. the covid19 health cordon , applied to the affected areas. 

Health cordon: taken on March 23, is established to count from Monday March 30, 2020 at 00h, a sanitary cordon around the municipalities most exposed to the pandemic that are Cotonou, Abomey-Calavi, Allada, Ouidah, Sèmè-Podji, Porto-Novo, Akpro-Missérété and Adjarra to isolate them from the rest of the country. 

ON April 14, more municipalities were added to the health cordon: After the evaluation of the measures taken by the Government as part of the response to the CORONAVIRUS pandemic (Covid-19), the cordon cordon established as of March 30, 2020 is maintained until Monday April 27, 2020 at midnight.

The said cordon is extended to new localities and now includes the following municipalities: Cotonou, Abomey-Calavi, Allada, Ouidah, Tori-Bossito, Kpomassè, Toffo, Zè, Sô-Ava, Aguégués, Sèmè-Podji, Porto-Novo, Akpro -Missérété, Adjara, and Atchoukpa (municipality of Avrankou).

# Canada 
*Answer*: 2 

*Comments*:
 The main and primary emergency responses, such as curfews, bans on gatherings, closing of workplaces and so on, have been taken by the Canadian states and not the federal government. However, the government has coordinated a lot of work, and many efforts have occured (school closings, curfews) have occured at the same time or within days of each other.  Furthermore, the measures taken have been largely similar wihtin the states. However, the reopening of the states looks to be very different due to the large differences in cases of Covid-19. This has therefore been coded as 2, as the states have taken largely the same measures at about the same time, but that there are some differences.

# Germany 
*Answer*: 2 

*Comments*:
 The federal government have coordinated a lot of the emergency response and implemented a set of measures during the pandemic that have resulted in a fairly similar response across most states. However, some states such as Bavaria and Thuringia have taken more far reaching responses, and there are also other states in which differing emergency measures have been imposed. While there thus are some states that do differ a lot from most others, the measures taken are not so different across the states that it results complete or almost complete sub-national variation, and this is therefore coded as 2.

# Iraq 
*Answer*: 2 

*Comments*:
 Several measures have been taken for the whole country, such as school closing, curfews,  limiting public gatherings, but there has also much regional variation. Baghdad and Najaf have imposed curfews and lockdowns beyond the national-level emergency response, and the Kurdish region of Iraq has have also imposed significant emergency measures such as lockdowns and limitations on movement. Considering that much repsonse has also been taken at the national level as well, this does not count as a complete sub-national variation, and therefore coded as 2.

# Italy 
*Answer*: 3 

*Comments*:
 Although the Italian Government have had numerous national response measures, the regional variation has (at least during parts of the development) differed substantially, most notably in the beginning of the spread of the Virus where only the Northern regions were in lockdown. While several measures later spread to all of Italy's regions, these large discrepancies in emergencye responses between regions at parts of the development is enough to code this as 3, that there is substantial sub-national variation.

# Turkey 
*Answer*: 0 

*Comments*:
 The emergency measures taken in Turkey are made by the national government, and I have found no indication that there is any sub-national variation in this. The government has, however, imposed curfews and lockdowns differently across the country, with stronger restrictions in highly populated areas, but these are actions taken by the national government and not by sub-national entitites.

# United Kingdom 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 The emergency measures have been implemented across the UK and the response is more or less uniform. However, England has started some reopening that differs from other parts of the UK, such as opening school for some age groups and allowing a larger set of people to gather at the same place. However, the variation is relatively small, and this is therefore coded as 1.

# United States of America 
*Answer*: 3 

*Comments*:
 The national emergency does not  determine how states respond to Covid-19, it opens up a lot of federal leeway to aid states and territories in differing ways and allows federal agencies to contribute to for example  health care and emergency actions. So it has been up to the states to themselves determine their response to the pandemic.  
The states differ in terms of what and how many emergency measures and Covid-19 related regulation they have enacted, as is  shown both by the National Governors Associations compilation of policy and legislation in all states and territories, and  in the National Conference of State Legislatures (an interest organisation for legislatures) compiling of data on state legislation during the pandemic.
While a lot of states have taken similar or the same actions on a number of areas, the overall difference - both in content and in the timing of initiating restricitons and beginning to lift them - lead the overall interpretation of the subnational variation to be coded as 3.
