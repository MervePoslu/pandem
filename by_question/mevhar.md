 A journalist was threated by a construction worker from a private company after filming violations of the curfew. The source that IPI refers to mentions that the company is favored by the government, but this is not sufficient to classify it as the government's agent.

*Comments*:
 1: On 8 May 2020, Chris Buckley a foreign correspondent with the NYT who spent 76 days in Wuhan reporting on the Covid-19 crisis, was forced out of China on May 8th after the authorities refused to renew his visa. The Australian native, based in China for the past 24 years, was personally attacked in recent months by Chinese state media for his reporting on the epidemic, which included how government secrecy delayed the fight against the virus and public anger over the death of whistleblower, Dr, Li Wenliang.
2: On 27 March 2020 at least 13 US foreign correspondents were forced to leave China. 
I have coded this as verbal harassment as they were asked/forced to leave the country and no physical harm was inflicted upon them.

Some of the attackers were wearing t-shirts identifying them as personnel from the National Identification Office, and others were wearing shirts identifying them as employees of the Ministry of the Interior and “Public Security,” according to a complaint filed by the journalists to the public prosecutor’s office, which CPJ reviewed.''

# Somalia 
*Answer*: 1 

*Comments*:
 The state is investigating and jailing journalists, accusing them of offending the honor or prestige of the head of state, or spreading fake news. Also, and more clearly verbal harassment, an official from the presidential palace reached a journalist via Twitter asking him where he got his sources.

 Several mentions of such incidents: for instance, ''Khaled and Salma also told us that they received ‘verbal orders’ from multiple Syrian intelligence officers to ‘bury the stories of these deaths’ and ‘not to raise any alarms’ in the media. ‘Given the total collapse of the economy and growing popular anger, the government doesn’t want to give the people an additional reason to revolt against them’ said Khaled.''
