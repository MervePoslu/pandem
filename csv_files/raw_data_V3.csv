The decrees are based on the Constitution and other legal acts, but the articles on which they are based are not related to emergency powers, but rather ''normal'' lawming powers. 
For example, the decrees  No. 20-69 of March 21, 2020, and 20-70 of March 24, 2020 refer legally to the Constitution, articles 99-4° and 143, or the law n° 88-07 du 7 Joumada Ethania 1408 correspondant au 26 janvier 1988 relative à l’hygiène, à la sécurité et à la médecine du travail ; 

Article 99 (4) of the Cosntitution: 
In addition to the powers explicitly conferred upon him by other provisions of the Constitution, the Prime Minister shall exercise the following functions:
4. he shall sign the executive decrees;

Art 143: Matters other than those earmarked for statutory legislation shall fall within the regulatory power of the President of the Republic. The implementation of the laws shall be a matter for the regulatory field of the Prime Minister

''Faced with the Covid-19 health crisis and the development of cases affecting the country, the Algerian Government has gradually taken a series of general measures aimed at containing the spread of the virus. These measures have been the subject of two main texts:

Executive Decree No. 20-69 of March 21, 2020 relating to measures to prevent and combat the spread of Coronavirus (Covid-19) and, the purpose of which is to establish measures of social distancing intended to prevent and combat the spread of COVID-19;
 
Executive Decree No. 20-70 of March 24, 2020 establishing additional measures to prevent and combat the spread of Coronavirus (Covid-19) and which has as its object the establishment of containment devices, restriction of circulation, framing of citizens' trade and supply activities, of rules of distancing as well as the methods of citizen mobilization in the national effort to prevent and combat the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic.''

","'Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, the government of Algeria headed by newly elected President Abdelmadjid Tebboune approved a bill amending the country’s penal code to criminalize the spreading of “false news” that harms national unity. The sweeping new law gives authorities powers to tackle misinformation about the virus, but also opens the door to possible censorship. Penalties range between two to five years in jail and carry fines of up to €3,600.''

LAW 20-06 AMENDING THE PENAL CODE - 
The amendments increase prison sentences for defamation, and introduce new penalties including prison sentences for the dissemination of false information. Under the amendments, new offenders face prison sentences of between one and three years. In addition, penalties are heightened if the offence takes place “at a time of a public health lockdown or a natural, biological or technological catastrophe or any other form of catastrophe,” with first time offenders facing up to five years in prison

The Algerian governmen, in an attempt to curb the very real dangers caused by dis- and misinformation disseminated by conspiracy theorists and fabulists has been to pass a new law criminalising the broadcast of “fake news” deemed harmful to “public order and state security”. The law, approved by parliament on 22 April, 2020, has come in for criticism by free speech activists, who point out that it could be used to curb independent reporting of the government’s failings in tackling the pandemic. These deficiencies, such as the lack of adequate preventative measures in hospitals, have prompted some doctors to post videos on social media in which they draw attention to the difficult circumstances they are working under. The new law could be used to suppress such reports.''

Security forces mobilized in large numbers to stop the demonstration, and police forces chased protesters and used clubs to beat them back.

Several activists, journalists, and students were arrested and accused of undermining national unity, including the famous journalist Khaled Drareni who was filming the protest live. Imene Meddour, a thirty-year-old mother, was arrested for posting a video that denounced the alleged corruption of officials managing a quarantine site in the city of Oran.

''Government officials in...,...Burundi,.....have exhibited disturbing denialism about COVID-19, depriving their publics of accurate information on the pandemic.''
In an interview with BBC, Jean-Claude Karerwa Ndenzako, the spokesperson for the President of Burundi, told the BBC why the country is so far spared by Covid-19.
''BBC. Does this mean that Burundi would still be spared from the Coronavirus pandemic thanks to its unparalleled love for God?

This I confirm and attest! But we are not saying that the epidemic cannot happen in Burundi. That is why we have prepared ourselves accordingly, but also according to the current situation in our country. But whether you believe it or not, Burundi is a country that has signed a special pact with God.''

Also, Burundi expelled the World Health Organization’s expert team working on coronavirus. ''Days before its May 20 election, Burundi has expelled an expert World Health Organization (WHO) team from the country, according to a foreign ministry letter obtained by the Associated Press. The team includes the WHO’s top country official, its country coronavirus coordinator, its head of communicable diseases for the country, and a laboratory expert focused on COVID-19 testing.

His crime was to have reported a comment about the economic effects of the Covid-19 crisis that the prime minister made during a press conference earlier in the day. As Sovann Rithy accurately reported in a Facebook post, Hun Sen said: “If motorbike-taxi drivers go bankrupt, sell your motorbikes for spending money.

","The National Assembly of Cameroon held its first session of 2020 from 20 March to 18 April and resumed sittings for its second session on 10 June. Decisions regarding the emergency response to Covid-19 have come primarily through the Prime Minister's office or public health authorities, without requiring approval from the parliament. Such measures include requiring masks and closing borders, curfews, social distancing measures and limits on public gatherings. Some of these have been eased since 30 April.","0","https://www.prc.cm/en/multimedia/documents/8228-government-response-strategy-to-the-coronavirus-pandemic-covid-19

","Cameroon’s Covid-19 reporting at the beginning of the pandemic was transparent; the minister of health published daily statistics on the number of infections, hospital admissions and casualties, but when the numbers grew substantially and Cameroon appeared as one of the top countries with covid19 cases in sub-saharan Africa, the government started revising its reporting strategy and access to information on the daily and actual number of new infections by switching to daily press briefings.

""It is now hard for journalists to get timely and detailed updates,"" said a reporter with a foreign broadcaster. ""The updates now are mostly on recovery and hospitalised cases and deaths.""

''Although there is no official limitation of access to Covid-19 related information, the government of Cameroon has however omitted from the public and mass media, vital information about the regional prevalence of Covid-19.''

''Media, civil society and opposition groups in Cameroon say the government there refused to provide official information about Covid-19 to media outlets and journalists perceived to be critical of it.''
''In Cameroon, the authorities are providing no information to several critical but very popular media outlets.''

''It was also highlighted that the Government seemed to refer to the Constitution primarily for electoral purposes instead of invoking it for addressing the country’s urgent needs due to the disastrous impact of COVID-19.  The Constitution indeed authorises the President to declare a state of emergency or use ‘exceptional powers’ in exceptional circumstances. Declaring a state of emergency would have allowed the National Assembly to enact a public health emergency law to address the effects of the pandemic. However, the government did not make use of these provisions - or any specific law - as a basis for the de facto emergency measures that it imposed on the population.''

The legislature continues to convene but with social distancing guidelines. On 20 May, it questioned the government's response to the pandemic, citing poor performance despite its emergency measures. In addition, the Constitutional Court ruled on 05 June that it would be unconstitutional for the president and parliamentary terms to be extended due to the pandemic. Elections scheduled for December 2020 and May 2020, respectively should continue as planned.

''On 5 June 2020, the Constitutional Court of the Central African Republic (CAR) rejected as unconstitutional a proposed constitutional amendment that would have allowed the extension of the duration of presidential and parliamentary terms in the case of ‘force majeure’. The proposed amendment emerged in a context of the disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic causing concerns over the timely organisation of presidential and legislative elections in December 2020 and March 2021, respectively.''

Article 85 When grave circumstances threaten, in an immediate manner, the independence or the integrity of the national territory or when they provoke the disruption of the regular functioning of the institutions, the President of the Republic proclaims a state of urgency or a state of siege after coordination with the Prime Minister and the Presidents of the two Chambers, in accordance with Articles 144 and 145 of this
Constitution.

of Ministers after the opinion of the Superior Council of Defense and the
authorization of the National Assembly and of the Senate, in accordance with Article
143 of this Constitution.

Article 144
In application of the provisions of Article 85 of this Constitution, the state of siege,
like the state of urgency, is declared by the President of the Republic.
The National Assembly and the Senate then convene of right. If they are not in
session, an extraordinary session is convoked to this effect in accordance with
Article 116 of this Constitution.
The closing of the ordinary or extraordinary sessions is[,] of right[,] delayed to
permit, as the case may be, the application of the provisions of the preceding
paragraph.
The state of urgency or the state of siege may be proclaimed for all or part of the
territory of the Republic for a time period of thirty days.
The ordinance proclaiming the state of urgency or the state of siege ceases[,] of
right[,] to produce its effects after the expiration of the time period specified in the
[fourth] paragraph of this article, unless the National Assembly and the Senate,
referred to [the matter] by the President of the Republic on decision of the Council
of Ministers, have authorized its extension for successive periods of fifteen days.
The National Assembly and the Senate can, by way of a law, end at any moment the
state of urgency or the state of siege.

Article 145
In case of a state of urgency or of state of siege, the President of the Republic takes,
by ordinances deliberated in the Council of Ministers, the measures necessary to
respond to the situation.
These ordinances are, on their signature, submitted to the Constitutional Court

","The Senate and National Assembly of the DRC decided on March 18 to suspend all sessions for the month of March due to COVID-19 (until April 5).
The regular session opened on 16 March, but all legislative activities were suspended from 18 March to 05 April due to Covid-19. Since then, the legislature has resumed with special rules of procedure for social distancing. While the legislature must approve the state of emergency, this gives powers to the executive to rule by decree ""the measures necessary to respond to the situation"" using ordinances deliberated through the Council of Ministers.

''State security forces, in responding to lawbreaking and violence, should respect human rights including only using force when strictly necessary. On March 29, Gen. Sylvano Kasongo, the head of police in Kinshasa, appeared to be ordering police officers to beat a motorcycle-taxi driver, in apparent “punishment” for violating social distancing measures, video footage indicated.''

''On March 30, the police killed at least 3 people and wounded 11 others, according to a UN source, when they fired live rounds at members of the Bundu dia Kongo politico-religious movement who were demonstrating in Kinshasa to “chase the spirit of the coronavirus.” The authorities should issue clear orders to the security forces that they are to act with restraint while enforcing restrictions in place.''

''On Tuesday, June 9, Kinshasa police used live fire to disperse merchants at the Central Market in Kinshasa. The merchants were trading despite the mandated closure of the market due to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Two people were reportedly killed during the police intervention, although it is not immediately clear if they were shot or trampled by the crowd.

2: The declaration is limited to three months. However this time limit can be extended for a similar period of time after obtaining the approval of two-thirds of the House members. Hence, a state of emergency could be continued indefinitely.

Despite this existing legal framework, the Emergency Law No. 2020-290 of March 23, 2020 is new legislation. This law adds several provisions to the nation’s Public Health Code, allowing the executive to declare a “state of health emergency” (état d’urgence sanitaire) in all or part of the country, and defining what that entails. A state of health emergency allows the government to severely curtail certain liberties in order to fight a pandemic or similar public health emergency. ''

The Italian government has since the state of emergency declaration issued a number of emergency measures through decree laws, which in the Italian legal system is an instrument that allows the Government to enact measures that become effective immediately, but which must be voted on by the Parliament within 60 days or the decree is terminated. Consequently, while the government has the power to present decrees which are implemented before the parliament votes on it, the parliament can terminate it as soon as it convenes to vote on the decree (Article 77, Italian Constitution). Since the Italian Parliament have continued its work throughout the pandemic (and so far approved all decree laws), this is regarded as not having affected their law making role. Furthermore, there's no indication that any of the emergency measures themselves have in any way affected the law making role of the parliament.

","The Covid-19 crisis has exacerbated pre-existing de facto discrimination against non-Kuwaiti nationals, despite some government action to try to redress migrant labour issues (particularly undocumented workers) and xenophobia. Some government lockdown measures were applied to neighbourhoods where many migrant workers live (there were cases of Covid-19 here so not coded), and the government has announced that as a result of the pandemic and associated economic crisis it will seek to reduce migrant labour numbers in future. This has contributed to an environment of discrimination against migrant labourers, including Kuwait MPs and journalists on state-owned media networks calling for deportation of migrants or restrictions on migrants to free up resources for nationals. Existing discrimination against migrant workers and the state’s unwillingness to hold Kuwaiti employers to account – for example over the non-payment of salaries – has resulted in a number of protests among migrant labourers, quelled by Kuwaiti security forces.","0","https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2020/04/covid19-makes-gulf-countries-abuse-of-migrant-workers-impossible-to-ignore/

https://ancl-radc.org.za/node/631","Lesotho declared a state of emergency over the coronavirus pandemic retrospectively on March 28, 2020, to be in force from March 18, and then again on April 15, 2020. He had, in the meantime, prorogued the Parliament on March 19. 

It is a bit unlcear what was the situation between the two declarations of state of emergency: 

''...onn Friday 27 March 2020, the Prime Minister pursuant to s 23(1) of the Constitution retrospectively declared a state of emergency from 18 March 2020. As shown above, since s 23(2) of the Constitution prescribes that a declaration of state of emergency automatically lapses at the expiration of 14 days from the date on which it was declared. It means that the state of emergency automatically lapsed on 8 April 2020 unless extended by Parliament....Lesotho is not the only country in the region that confers powers to the head of the executive to declare a state of emergency without parliamentary approval.''

''As alluded to earlier, the Prime Minister has the power to declare the state of emergency without the approval of Parliament. However, only Parliament has the power to extend such a declaration from the initial 14 days. The problem in Lesotho is that the state of emergency was declared at a time when Parliament was prorogued. This means that there was no constitutional authority to extend the state of emergency beyond the 14 days that the Prime Minister is allowed to establish. Realizing this constitutional reality, on 15 April 2020, the Prime Minister re-declared the state of emergency from 15 April 2020 to 28 April 2020. Whilst this was legally correct under those circumstances, it does raise questions about the legal position that persisted between 8 April and 15 April 2020. Was there a state of emergency during this period? Were the things done or enforced during this period constitutionally sanctioned? The answers to some of these or other questions remain unclear and may never be found.''

Constitution (1993), section 23 (1).
23. Declaration of emergency - 1. In time of war or other public emergency which threatens the life of the nation, the Prime Minister may, acting in accordance with the advice of the Council of State, by proclamation which shall be published in the Gazette, declare that a state of emergency exists for the purposes of this Chapter.

''In addition to s 23 of Constitution, Parliament has enacted statutes that enable the state to implement a state of emergency situations. Among these statutes is the Emergency Powers Act of 1988 and the Disaster Management Act 2 of 1997. Section 23 of the Constitution is read and implemented together with the Emergency Powers Act and the Disaster Management Act.''

","The text of the Law  n ° 91-011 of July 18, 1991 relating to exceptional situations, mentions:
Art. 17 - The proclamation of the emergency situation automatically confers on the President of the Republic the power, by regulatory means:
                6. To take all measures to ensure the control of the press of publications and broadcasts of all kinds and to prohibit those which are likely to disturb public order or endanger national unity;

The Decree N ° 2020 –359 of March 21, 2020 proclaiming a state of health emergency, mentions:
Article 4.- The Minister of National Defense...... the Minister of Posts, Telecommunications and Digital Development, the Minister of Communication and Culture,......are each responsible as far as he is concerned, of the execution of this decree.

''...the Malagasy authorities have taken some of the most restrictive measures for the media in Africa. Radio stations and television channels are obliged to broadcast official information on the coronavirus, under penalty of sanction. This directive should not be subject to any restriction on the information that the media may publish according to the Minister of Communication. Free-to-air programs giving voice to listeners were also banned as part of the state of health emergency.''

The Madagascan authorities, responding to accusations of restricitng media freedoms (see more on this on the following media variables), said:

""The press is one of the services that are automatically requisitioned""
If Madagascan journalists are worried about this tense context, the Minister of Communication wants to clarify the situation. ""There is absolutely no restriction of their freedom of expression per se, but - it is true and we assume it, because that is the law which authorizes and which says it - the press is part of the services that are requisitioned as part of a state of emergency , justifies Lalatiana Rakotondrazafy. So we ask all the media in Madagascar to disseminate information on everything related to the coronavirus without asking them for any restriction in the information they can publish.""

(original in French: « La presse fait partie des services qui sont réquisitionnés d'office »
Si les journalistes malgaches s'inquiètent de ce contexte tendu, la ministre de la Communication veut clarifier la situation. « Il n'y a absolument pas de restriction de leur liberté d'expression en soi, mais - c'est vrai et nous l'assumons, parce que ça c'est la loi qui l'autorise et qui le dit - la presse fait partie des services qui sont réquisitionnés d'office dans le cadre d'un état d'urgence, justifie Lalatiana Rakotondrazafy. Donc on demande à tous les médias de Madagascar de diffuser les informations sur tout ce qui tourne autour du coronavirus sans pour autant leur demander une quelconque restriction dans les informations qu'ils peuvent publier. »

""She  was not a journalist and it was not in the course of her work that she was accused,  "" insists the minister, who specifies that this host works for a channel which belongs to a minister of the current government.
Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the two women do not know when the trial will take place and this is what worries all the more Amnesty International and the Union de la Presse Francophone.''

''On 20 April, President Andry Rajoelina himself launched Covid-Organics (CVO), an “improved traditional remedy with curative and preventive properties” against the coronavirus, as he described it.
Officially developed by the Malagasy Institute of Applied Research (IMRA), the remedy is an infusion derived from artemisia and other plants which remain secret. It comes in the form of a liquid or infusion, with a defined dosage....The remedy’s discovery has also pushed authorities to ease lockdown restrictions.''

Other than that, the ministry of health's website provides accurate information on covid19 - how it spreads, what to do to protect against it etc.

","'Tensions heightened after a police officer allegedly beat a street vendor, accused of violating an afternoon ban on commercial activities. Images of the victim were shared on social media, sparking fury among residents of Toamasina in eastern Madagascar.''
''The police have denied perpetrating any violence and instead allege that the street vendor had returned home following a short visit to the hospital. Protestors burnt tires, blocked roads and threw stones at security forces who, in turn, fired rubber bullets. The protestors claimed that COVID-19 did not exist in the town and the state was manipulating them.''

However, on April 1, 2020, the Council of Ministers invoked article 60 of the Constitution (1991), which gives special powers to the government for a limited period of time: 

''Article 60 -After the agreement of the President of the Republic, the Government can, for the execution of its program, demand of the Parliament the authorization of taking by ordinance, for a limited period, the measures that are normally of the domain of the law.

They enter into force as soon as they are published, but they become lapsed if the Bill of the law of ratification is not deposited before [devant] the Parliament before [avant] the date established by the enabling law. At the expiration of the time mentioned in the first paragraph of this Article, the ordinances cannot be modified[,] except by the law[,] in the matters that are of the legislative domain. The enabling law lapses if the National Assembly is dissolved.''

''Council of Ministers: Approval of a bill authorizing the Government to take all the measures necessary to fight against the Covid pandemic19. - Nouakchott, 04/01/2020
The Council under the Chairmanship of His Excellency Mohamed Ould Cheikh El-Ghazouani, President of the Republic, examined and approved a draft enabling law authorizing the Government, in application of article 60 of the Constitution, to take by ordinances during a limited time, all the necessary measures, which are normally of the domain of the law, to fight the Covid pandemic19. 
This bill is part of the actions initiated by the Government to protect our populations against the spread of Covid19 which is wreaking havoc in several countries of the world.
It will consolidate the efforts undertaken since the onset of this exceptional and unprecedented pandemic, by giving the Government the flexibility and the related legal instruments to act with the required speed and in a timely manner.

The first measures were taken on March 15, when 
''The Prime Minister and an Interministerial Committee announce their decision to suspend all events and demonstrations, and restrict border crossings.''
-On March 18, a night curfew was put in place.
-On March 28, the Mauritanian government announced that as of Sunday, March 29 at 12:00 noon,  all road traffic and movement of persons between the wilayas (regions) is prohibited, except for health workers, service delivery missions (e.g., water, electricity, telecommunications) and the transportation of goods.

https://www.stortinget.no/en/In-English/About-the-Storting/News-archive/Front-page-news/2019-2020/the-storting-constitutes-coronavirus-special-committee/","The IPU Reports that: ""The Norwegian Parliament (the Storting) introduced a number of measures which will be in place until end of April. These measures include: the number of MPs at plenary meetings and during voting is reduced to 87 from 102; plenary will take decisions only on urgent issues identified by the presidency following consultations with leaders of party groups in Parliament; some rules of procedure are temporarily suspended (deadlines, physical presence in Committee meetings with priority given to tele/video conferencing); reduced committee workload (priority given to urgent cases and bills); cancellation of international and domestic committee members travel. The Storting also established a coronavirus special committee. On 21 March, Parliament adopted the Enabling Act authorizing Government to make decisions which, according to the Constitution, must be taken in Parliament. The aim is to enable Government to take measures to limit the disruption of the normal functioning of society and mitigate the negative consequences of the pandemic for the population and on the economy. The Act is valid for a month but can also be repealed by the Storting at any given time.""
Consequently, the law making role of the parliament is somewhat decreased as the government is given the right to make decisions that parliament usually needs to approve. However, as the parliament also passed an amendment on this stating that "" If at least one-third of the total number of Members does not support a regulation or parts of a regulation, the MPs in question may send a written declaration to the Storting’s Presidium. As soon as the Presidium receives such a declaration, it will notify the Government. The Corona Act obligates the King to revoke the regulations in question with immediate effect."" (https://www.stortinget.no/en/In-English/About-the-Storting/News-archive/Front-page-news/2019-2020/the-corona-act/)
Therefore, the parliament is still involved in urgent law making during the presence of the Corona Act, and only a third of the MPs is needed to revoke any regulation. Considering this, the law making role is regarded to not have been affected, since it both involved in some urgency law making and can revoke them.",NA,NA,NA,"0","https://www.hrw.org/news?country[]=9615

I found no time limit on the duration of the state of epidemic and the emergency measures in the order declaring a state of epidemic (Order 491 from 20 March 2020, http://www.dziennikustaw.gov.pl/D2020000049101.pdf). The emergency measures that apply for the duration of the state of epidemic are covid-19 related measures such as restrictions on movement (border crossing and similar) (Chapter 2), Restrictions or prohibitions on the marketing and use of certain items (masks, disinfectant and similar) (Chapter 3),  Restrictions on the functioning of certain institutions or workplaces (Chapter 4) , Prohibition of organizing shows and other gatherings of the population (Chapter 5), access to real estate, premises and areas provided for by anti-epidemic plans (Chapter 6). 

The state of epidemic was declared based on “the Act on specific solutions related to the prevention and combating COVID and other infectious diseases and crises they caused” (from 7 March 2020, http://dziennikustaw.gov.pl/D2020000037401.pdf), which amended “Act on preventing and combating infections and infectious diseases” (5 December 2008). According to Article 36 of the Act from 7 March, Articles 3-6 (on remote work, additional care allowance, airport regulations and procurement) and Articles 10-14 (on central government’s authority to give orders to local governments, changes to construction, tourism and transportation industries) a 180-day time limit and Article 31 (on budget transfers) has a 365-day time limit. The rest of the provisions (related to the “functioning of the health care system, telecommunication or state's Sanitary and Epidemiological Stations”, https://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra_uploads/poland-report-covid-19-april-2020_en.pdf) amend existing regulations and are permanent changes to the “Act on preventing and combating infections and infectious diseases”.

The state of epidemic is also different from the state of emergency that has a 90-day time limit based on the Constitution (Article 230, point 1). While some specific emergency measures under a state of epidemic have a time limit, the state of epidemic was declared until further notice, therefore coded as 0.",NA,NA,NA,"0","https://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra_uploads/poland-report-covid-19-april-2020_en.pdf http://www.dziennikustaw.gov.pl/D2020000037401.pdf","Based on the act on specific solutions related to the prevention and combating COVID and other infectious diseases and crises they caused (2 March 2020), the Council of Ministers can declare a state of epidemic or epidemic threat; no provisions on legislature approval","0","https://www.senat.gov.pl/aktualnosci/art,12605,senacki-projekt-zmiany-ustawy-dotyczacej-walki-z-koronawirusem.html https://www.senat.gov.pl/aktualnosci/art,12605,senacki-projekt-zmiany-ustawy-dotyczacej-walki-z-koronawirusem.html https://www.senat.gov.pl/aktualnosci/art,12629,senackie-poprawki-do-ustaw-dotyczacych-walki-z-koronawirusem.html","Based on the act on specific solutions related to the prevention and combating COVID and other infectious diseases and crises they caused (2 March 2020), the Council of Ministers has to submit a report on the implementation to the Sejm every 3 months; no evidence of legislature approval","1","https://www.senat.gov.pl/diariusz/posiedzenia-senatu/ https://www.ipu.org/country-compilation-parliamentary-responses-pandemic#P","MP's are allowed to vote remotely and oversee emergency measures.","0","https://www.gov.pl/web/koronawirus","Uniform measures throughout the country","0","https://www.gov.pl/web/koronawirus https://www.hrw.org/europe/central-asia/poland https://www.amnesty.org/en/countries/europe-and-central-asia/poland/","No de-jure disciminating provisions and no information on de-facto discrimination found","0","https://www.gov.pl/web/koronawirus https://www.hrw.org/europe/central-asia/poland https://www.amnesty.org/en/countries/europe-and-central-asia/poland/","No measures violating non-derogable rights found","0","https://www.icnl.org/covid19tracker/?location=100&issue=&date=&type= https://www.coe.int/en/web/media-freedom/all-alerts https://cpj.org/europe/poland/","No evidence of measures limiting media freedom found",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0","https://www.gov.pl/web/koronawirus https://cpj.org/europe/poland/ https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/06/poland-activists-at-risk-of-10-year-jail-term-for-covid-19-poster-campaign-challenging-government-statistics/https://ipi.media/romania/","information on covid-19 on the government's website; no reports on limitations on media reporting on covid-19 found.

http://paulkagame.com/?p=15265","Rwanda did not declare a state of emergency, nor took measures based on a specific legal instrument. The government announced several measures, which were taken gradually.
''In early March a taskforce was assembled and guidelines were issued on 6 March on social distancing and handwashing, and hand sanitiser was placed outside all major public buildings and shopping centres. Testing began well before the first COVID-19 case, which was verified on 14 March.''  

On March 14, the government announced new measures: 
''Statement on New Measures to Prevent COVID-19 Coronavirus Transmission
14 March 2020
Following assessment by the Ministry of Health, the following measures shall be observed for an initial
period of two weeks in order to further strengthen the country’s ability to mitigate the risk of COVID19 coronavirus transmission:
• Places of worship are closed from Sunday 15 March 2020, with prayers to be conducted from
home
• Schools and higher education institutions (both public and private) shall close on Monday 16
March 2020
• Employees should be permitted to work from home wherever possible, in consultation with
their employers
• Large gatherings such as weddings and sporting events are to be postponed, and the number
of people attending burial ceremonies should be minimised
• Businesses and restaurants continue to operate, but adequate distance between customers
must be maintained (at least 1 meter)
• Unnecessary movements should be avoided, and public transport must not be overcrowded''.

On March 21, the government announced enhanced measures, including a 2-week lockdown:
''Rwanda put on 2-week lockdown from March 21 11:59 pm. Inter-city travel banned. Only food-selling stores, gas stations and pharmacies to operate. All workers both private and public to work from home except for essential services. All Borders are closed''",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2","International IDEA Parliaments in the pandemic

These have originated from the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Local Government, and the Office of the Prime Minister, who has increasingly handled the government emergency response through the Cabinet. All of these decrees have originated from the executive, without direct vote from the legislature. The legislature continues to meet, but less regularly and with social distancing measures.

The lockdown on March 21 indeed affected the parliamentary meetings , which were held online, and the first time the Parliament convened since the partial lift of the Lockdown was on an extraordinary session on May 13 ''to allow to vote on and allow the Government to take loans meant to hasten the distribution of electricity''.

The arrest was triggered by a remembrance service they held earlier that day with supporters of the United Front for Democracy against Dictatorship – known as the “Red Shirts” – to mark the 6th anniversary of the 2014 military coup. 

2: Thai authorities previously arrested Anurak on the same charges on May 13, when he held a remembrance service to demand justice for those killed and wounded by the military during the crackdown on the 2010 Red Shirts protests. Even though thermal scanners to detect fevers were provided at the events and participants wore face masks, the activists were accused of ignoring social distancing, acting in a way likely to spread the virus, and disobeying lawful orders in both cases. If found guilty, they face two years in prison and a 40,000 baht (US$1,250) fine.

3: In southern Thailand, local authorities in Songkhla province denied a request by villagers in Singha Nakhon district to hold a rally on May 24 in protest of the government’s plan to build beach walls and breakwaters on Muang Ngam Beach.

2: Government representatives at a press conference on 25 March 2020 said that they would restrict the media to only reporting official information on COVID-19 and prosecute individuals whose statements are deemed critical of authorities’ COVID-19 response are of particular concern. At the press conference Prime Minister Prayut Chan-O-Cha stated that journalists would be prevented from interviewing officials and medical personnel and restricted to only covering information disseminated at official press conferences. Prime Minister Prayut Chan-O-Cha’s warning to “be careful about what they post on social media”, and threats of prosecutions for “abuse of social media” at a separate press conference on 24 March 2020 also fuel fears that authorities plan to disproportionately restrict online expression about COVID-19.","0","https://rsf.org/en/thailand

(1)
Before the president's declaration, on March 30, 2020, the Togolese National Assembly passed Law No. 2020-005 (2), empowering the Government to take measures under the law by Ordinance. Thus in his address to the Nation of April 1, 2020, the Head of State decreed a state of health emergency, which will be sanctioned by the April 2020 Ordinance determining the conditions of implementation of the state of emergency in Togo, itself ratified by decree N ° 2020-024 declaring a state of health emergency.
Yet, although the provisions of article 86 of the constitution provide that “the law fixes the rules concerning (…) the state of siege and the state emergency ”crossed with those of article 94 according to which“ organic law determines the conditions of implementation of the state of siege or the state of emergency , according to critics (see source 7, 8), ''the organic law is otherwise non-existent, at least not found.''
Also, the same critics (mainly source 8), question the legitimacy of the state of emergency in Togo, despite the constitution having such provisions, and despite the president citing the respective articles of the Constitution:

''As a reminder, the National Assembly adopted on March 27, in accordance with article 86 of the Constitution, a law empowering the Government to take, for a period of six months, measures within the domain of the law to combat spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19) and protect the population from the risks of contamination. In his address to the nation on 1 st April, the head of state declared a public health emergency for a period of three months. However, the publication of the decree on the state of emergency is still desired. The consequence is that since the speech of the Head of State, Togo is under a de facto state of emergency.
...''These measures, which, moreover, are taken in simple press releases, have no legal basis. This results in a lot of confusion and a lack of coherence and coordination in the measures taken....''
''Article 94 paragraph 5 of the Constitution provides that "" an organic law determines the conditions for implementing the state of siege and the state of emergencymore than necessary to find a legal basis for the measures likely to be taken. To do this, and in the face of the emergency, the Government took advantage of the enabling law of March 30 to define the legal framework for the state of emergency by ordinance.''

Coded as 1 instread of 2 because the Constitution does not offer a distinct provision for a state of health emergency, despite the fact that what was officially declared was a state of health emergency (the constitution articles looks as if it allows for adjusted language to the nature of the crisis (e.g. “state of siege”) as warranted.","Constitution art 86 and 94.

Photos of a young man who suffered a ghastly eye injury at the hands of security forces went viral within the community. Some expressed sympathy for the victim. Others showed support for the soldiers purportedly doing their jobs. Soon, however, the reports escalated. A video emerged of an old woman who had been severely wounded by soldiers after allegedly violating the curfew. Days later, a young man named Gueli Kodjo Djifa died after being beaten.

So it has been up to the states to themselves determine their response to the pandemic.  
The states differ in terms of what and how many emergency measures and Covid-19 related regulation they have enacted, as is  shown both by the National Governors Associations compilation of policy and legislation in all states and territories, and  in the National Conference of State Legislatures (an interest organisation for legislatures) compiling of data on state legislation during the pandemic.

All these are, by the governments own agencies, the WHO as well as numerous other sources, deemed inaccurate.
Many of the claims have also been repeated, and when questioned, the president have defended many of them.
However, government agencies and agents, most prominently the CDC, have also provided information fully in accordance with WHO, and have also contested many of  the presidents claims.
